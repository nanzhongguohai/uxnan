# Changelog

All notable changes to the `uxnanmobile` app are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **File attachment selection and delivery for analysis.** The composer "+" action
  menu now features a "Document / file" option (`UxIcons.description`) backed by
  `AttachmentPickerService.pickFiles` (using `file_picker`), allowing users to pick
  arbitrary documents, logs, code files, and configs (up to 10 MB). The composer
  renders attached files as compact chips (`_FileChip` with file icon, original filename,
  formatted size, and remove button), and serializes them as `FileContent` attachments
  on `turn/send` alongside images. Message bubbles display attached files above the
  bubble in `ImageThumbStrip`.
- **Direct APK in-app update channel with update prompt dialog.** Supports checking updates via connected Bridge LAN endpoints (`/app/version`) and user-configurable custom update URLs. Features in-app direct APK downloading with live progress, prompting with `AppUpdateDialog` (version comparison, release notes, background download, and immediate install), and invoking Android's native package installer via `FileProvider` (`dev.luisgamas.uxnanmobile.fileprovider`) and `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`.
- **"New with same config" thread context action.** Long-pressing a thread in the conversation list now offers a "New with same config" option (`UxIcons.addComment`) which creates a new thread retaining the same agent type, model configuration, and working directory/project without manual reconfiguration.

### Changed
- **64-bit ARM ABI filter for reduced APK size.** Configured `ndk.abiFilters` to include only `arm64-v8a` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`, excluding legacy 32-bit (`armeabi-v7a`, `x86`) and emulator `x86_64` native binaries to significantly reduce Android APK size for 64-bit devices (from 117 MB down to 47 MB).
- **Accelerated APK packaging without R8 minification.** Set `isMinifyEnabled = false` and `isShrinkResources = false` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to skip the slow R8 optimization step during APK packaging, accelerating incremental release builds down to ~24s.

### Fixed
- **Multi-device thread synchronization & `loadThreads` response parsing.** Fixed an issue where `ThreadManager.loadThreads` strictly required a bare `List` and dropped responses returning `{ "threads": [...] }` (`ThreadList` contract shape). `loadThreads` now accepts both shapes, correctly sets `deviceId` based on the active connection, and automatically pulls threads whenever a device connection is established or switched.
- **Real-time multi-device thread event handling.** Implemented handling for `stream/thread/started`, `stream/thread/deleted`, `stream/thread/archived`, and `stream/thread/unarchived` in `IncomingMessageProcessor` and `ThreadManager`, updating the local SQLite database in real time so actions taken on one phone or desktop are immediately reflected on other connected phones without needing a manual refresh.
- **Prevent background turn deltas from contaminating foreground conversations.** `ThreadManager._applyEvent` now resolves missing `threadId`s on streaming turn events using `turnId` and the `_live` active turn map before falling back to `_activeThreadId`.
- **Clear stranded live turn on reconnect when bridge reports no active turn.** `ThreadManager._resyncThread` now detects when `page.activeTurnId == null` and removes any stale in-flight `_live` buffer, clears awaiting-input state, and resets thread activity to idle. This unblocks conversations that were left in an endless spinning/generating state when a bridge daemon restarted or disconnected mid-turn.
- **Wire automatic update check on bridge connection.** Connected bridge hosts (`connectedBridgeHostsProvider`) are now reactively aggregated from live connected endpoints, active device direct addresses, and paired trusted devices (`activeBridgeHostsProvider`). App launch and reconnect now immediately check for direct updates against the active bridge, prompting with `AppUpdateDialog` when a newer build is detected.


## [0.0.22-alpha.20260815+20260815] - 20260815
### Changed — the model shows the name you read, not the id the CLI routes on
The app bar's model pill showed the routing id the agent CLI needs
(`gemini-3.7-flash-high`), truncated to fit — so the one place the active model
is always visible said the least about it. It now shows the readable name the
bridge reports for that id ("Gemini 3.7 Flash (High)"), with the id itself one
long-press away in the tooltip (still the version the agent resolved, when it
reports one). The **New conversation** model field follows the picker sheet
instead: readable name over routing id, so on agents that route through many
providers the id keeps telling near-identical names apart.

Nothing changes in what is sent to the PC — the thread still stores and sends
the routing id — and a model the bridge doesn't list (offline, an older bridge)
still shows its id rather than an empty chip.

### Changed
- The conversation's **Session info** sheet no longer says the ids are only good
  for the agent's CLI: they open the same conversation in the agent's **desktop
  app** too, and it names the one condition that matters — the conversation must
  not be running a turn on the phone at that moment. The hint was written when a
  Codex conversation started here could not be opened anywhere else (fixed in
  the bridge: it now hands the agent session back between turns).

## [0.0.21-alpha.20260813+20260813] - 20260813
### Changed — the PC decides where a conversation's worktree goes

Starting a conversation in a fresh worktree no longer sends a folder the phone
made up. On a bridge that advertises `features.managedWorktrees`, the phone
sends no path at all and the bridge places the checkout under the folder it
manages (`~/uxnan/worktrees/<project>/<branch>` by default), which is exactly
where the desktop app puts it.

That is the fix, not a preference: the phone derived
`<parent>/<repo>-<branch>` and the desktop `<parent>/<repo>--<branch>`, with
different rules for turning a branch name into a folder name — so one project's
worktrees ended up split across two folder schemes depending on which app made
them. Against an older bridge, which still requires a path, the phone keeps
deriving one, now spelled exactly the way the desktop spells it.

### Fixed — back from Settings returned to the launcher instead of the overview

On a phone, opening Settings from the overview and pressing Android's back
button left the app. Same from Profile. The app bar's own arrow worked from
those very screens, and so did back from anywhere deeper — overview → Settings →
Profile went back to Settings normally — which made it look like there were two
Profile screens. There is one, at one route; what differed was the depth.

Android does not ask the app when back is pressed. Through the predictive-back
dispatcher — which this app is on, targeting SDK 36 — the platform acts on a
claim published *ahead* of the press: `SystemNavigator.setFrameworkHandlesBack`,
which Flutter derives from the last `NavigationNotification` to reach
`WidgetsApp`. When that claim says the framework does not handle back, the
platform closes the activity without ever calling into Flutter — which is
exactly why the arrow, and every in-app pop, kept working on the screens that
were leaving the app.

The shell returned the router's navigator **bare** on its four full-screen
routes (onboarding, pairing, settings, profile). That unregistered the scope
answering for back and published precisely that claim. Reaching one of those
routes from a deeper screen changed nothing in the shell, so the earlier claim
stood and back behaved.

The same false claim was reaching tablets from the other direction. A pane
opened with `go` **replaces** the route rather than stacking on it, so the
shell's navigator holds a single page and publishes its own "nothing to pop" —
from below the scope answering for back, and late enough to overrule it. The
first back press on a deep-linked conversation therefore closed an app visibly
full of work, in spite of the handler written to empty the pane instead.

The shell now mounts one back scope on **every** route, at one fixed place in
the tree, and replaces a "nothing to pop" coming from below with the truth on
its way up — the same upgrade an ordinary `Navigator` performs for its own
subtree. Layouts, the route table and what every screen renders are untouched:
back pops the screen you opened, empties the pane on a tablet, and still leaves
the app from the overview, where there is genuinely nothing left.

Eight tests pin both halves at both widths: the claim the app publishes before
the press, and what the press then does.

## [0.0.20-alpha.20260812+20260812] - 2026-08-12

### Changed — a long reply no longer slows itself down while it streams

Past a few thousand characters an answer started arriving in small jerks, and
the longer it got the worse it was. The whole accumulated reply was re-parsed
and re-laid-out on every delta, so showing a turn cost time that grew with the
turn's own length.

Measured on a real phone in a profile build: under 4 500 characters the reply
cost 5.4 ms per frame at p95 and dropped 4 janky frames out of 2 761; past that
it cost 28.1 ms and dropped 97 out of 1 381 — one frame in fourteen. The raster
stayed at 3.7 ms throughout, so nothing was slow to draw; it was slow to build.

The prose is now cut at boundaries that can never move again, and every finished
piece keeps its widget, which Flutter skips instead of rebuilding. Only the part
still being written is rebuilt.

The cut is deliberately timid, because Markdown split in the wrong place renders
differently: it only ever cuts at a blank line outside a fenced code block that
is followed by a line which unmistakably starts a new block. It never cuts
between the items of a list, inside a quote, a table, indented code, or a code
fence — so a list-heavy answer simply does not split, which costs a missed
optimization and never costs fidelity. That it looks identical is not an
assertion: the same Markdown is rendered whole and split and compared pixel by
pixel, which is how the 8 px of block spacing lost at each seam was caught.

Measured again on the same phone afterwards, over 4 500 characters: p95 down
from 28.1 ms to **11.0 ms**, worst frame from 64.0 ms to 21.9 ms, and dropped
frames from 97 in 1 381 (7.0%) to 16 in 1 317 (**1.2%**). The shape matters more
than the totals — the cost stopped growing with the reply:

```
before   5k:18ms → 6k:22ms → 8k:30ms → 10k:35ms → 11k:36ms
after    4k:12ms → 5k:12ms →  7k:11ms →  8k:9ms
```

### Fixed — a whole exchange shown twice, and it stayed that way

A conversation showed the same exchange twice — your message and the reply —
and reopening it changed nothing, because both copies really were in the
phone's store. Measured on the device: the second copy carried a **different
turn id**, the agent's own session id, so this was never the phone duplicating
anything. The bridge had stored the same turn twice after reading the agent's
own transcript, and the phone faithfully rendered both. That is fixed on the
bridge side.

The phone's part was that it could never let go: a re-sync only ever inserted
and updated, so a turn the bridge had dropped stayed on screen forever. It now
removes what the bridge no longer reports, which is also what makes a
conversation converge after it is cleaned up on the PC.

Deliberately narrow, so a re-sync can never eat real history: only inside the
window the fetched page covers — an older page loaded by scrolling up is left
alone — never the turn streaming right now, one still waiting in the queue, or
the echo that has no turn id yet, and never a message written after the sync
began, which is what lets a message sent while the page was in flight survive.

### Fixed — the first message of a conversation came back doubled

Reported from a phone, in a fresh conversation, with no thread switching: the
message you sent appeared twice, and both copies survived closing and reopening
— so both were really in the store.

Opening a conversation starts a re-sync against the bridge, and the echo written
the moment you hit send carries **no turn id** until `turn/send` answers. The
re-sync decides what it already has by turn id, so for those few milliseconds
the echo was invisible to it and the bridge's copy of the same message was
inserted beside it.

The clue that pinned it was that the **second** message of a conversation never
duplicated: by then no re-sync is in flight, so there is no window to land in.

The re-sync now adopts a local echo that has no turn id yet — same row, stamped
with the turn it turned out to belong to — instead of inserting next to it.
Matched on the text the bridge echoes back and consumed on first match, so two
identical sends still reconcile one each.

### Changed — the empty drawer offers onboarding, not the camera

With no PC paired, the drawer header's button went straight to the QR scanner.
Whoever sees that button usually has no bridge installed either, and a camera
pointed at nothing explains none of that. It opens onboarding now, which
installs the bridge and then hands off to the very same scanner — so nobody who
already has one loses a step worth mentioning. The overview's "pair another PC"
menu is unchanged: it names both the scanner and the manual code, and it is
asked by someone who already has a PC.

### Fixed — opening a second conversation in the same pane

On a tablet, picking another conversation changed the app bar while the body
kept rendering the one you left — and the agent's answer would hang on
"responding", or arrive duplicated.

One cause for all three. go_router keys a page by the route **pattern**
(`/conversation/:threadId`), not by the location it matched, so every thread
produced the same page: replacing one with another handed Flutter a page it
considered identical, the element was reused, and `initState` never ran again.
The screen's whole per-thread startup lives there — `selectThread`,
`resumeThread`, the foreground marker — so the ThreadManager was never told to
switch. The app bar still looked right because it reads `widget.threadId`
directly; the body follows the *manager's* active thread. And streaming deltas,
which do not all carry a threadId of their own, kept being attributed to the
thread you had left — hence the turn that never finished, and the turn that
reappeared once the real thread re-synced against the bridge.

Every parameterised route now keys its screen by its parameter, so a different
thread (or PC) is a different element and restarts exactly as it does on a
phone. It was **four** routes, not one: the per-PC threads list, its archive and
the PC details screen had the same latent bug, and the threads list also starts
per-PC work in `initState`.

A phone was never affected: there opening pushes, which always builds a new
element. Nothing outside the app changed — no bridge or contract work — so this
runs against any bridge the app already worked with.

## [0.0.19-alpha.20260810+20260810] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed — the profile stopped being clamped to a paragraph's width

`NeScaffold` already stops every screen at its window class's content width
(840 / 1040 / 1200), measured from its own constraints. The profile added a
**second, tighter** clamp of 760 dp on top — a typographic line length, right
for the conversation and the file viewer and wrong for a stats grid, provider
cards and a 53-week heatmap. A laptop showed a third of its width empty while
the heatmap squeezed its weeks inside a paragraph.

Removing the extra clamp is the whole fix: 1008 dp on a 1200 dp laptop and
1168 dp on a 1600 dp monitor, instead of 760 dp everywhere. **A phone renders
exactly what it did before.**

### Changed — the new-conversation form is bounded on a wide window

M3's full-screen dialog is a compact-window pattern. On a tablet the form spread
across the whole width, so the eye had to cross the window between the agent
list and **Start**, and the drawer it was launched from disappeared entirely.

It is now a dialog of at most 560×720 over whatever is there. **The content is
byte-for-byte the same** — the agent cards, the working-directory card, the
worktree toggle, the model field — and a phone still gets the full-screen
dialog it always had. Only the container changed.

### Fixed — the back button on a tablet sitting at the overview

The OS back button threw `Null check operator used on a null value` inside
`GoRouterDelegate._findCurrentNavigator`, and went nowhere.

The shell was showing the welcome pane at the root by rendering it **instead of**
the router's `child` — and that child is not just a screen, it is the navigator
the whole route table lives in. Unmounting it left `go_router` dereferencing a
null `navigatorKey.currentState` on every back press, so back was broken for the
entire app the whole time the overview was open, which is where a tablet starts.

The shell now always renders `child`; **what the root shows is the route's
business**, and the root route answers it — the overview on a phone, the quiet
welcome pane beside a drawer. Nothing changes visually.

### Changed — the file tree measures its own surface, and files stay a stack

The file browser centred its tree against the **window**. Inside the shell's
content pane a 320 dp drawer is already spent, so it pushed the tree off to one
side of the space it actually had. It measures its constraints now, like the
conversation.

**Files is not becoming two panes**, and neither is git. Two panes is the
ceiling: beside the drawer, a tree plus a viewer would be a third column, and a
tablet has no room for three that anyone enjoys using. The browser already
pushes the viewer inside the content pane, which is the right shape — the drawer
stays put, and back returns to the tree.

### Added — Settings shows a section beside its list on a wide surface

The list stays on the left and the section fills the right, with the open one
marked — the same `secondaryContainer` the conversation list uses, because it
is the same question: which of these am I looking at. On a phone nothing
changes; a section is still a screen you push, and marking a row you cannot see
behind it would be marking nothing.

There is **no "pick a section" placeholder**. With room for both, a section is
more useful than an instruction to tap one — and the one that opens is your
**profile**, which is the row the list is headed by and the one you most likely
came for.

The profile card behaves like the sections it sits among: it fills the pane and
is marked while it does, rather than opening a whole new screen. It looks more
like a section than anything else in that list, and it was the only row that did
not act like one.

**Settings and profile are destinations, not content**, so on a wide window
they own it: no drawer beside them. You *went* to them, and the conversation
list has no bearing on what they show — keeping it up would have put three
columns on a tablet, one of which could not change anything on screen.

The width that decides the internal split is **the surface's, not the
window's**. That still matters: these screens are full-window now, but the same
`TwoPaneScaffold` is used inside the shell's content pane elsewhere, where a
320 dp drawer is already spent. Below ~840 dp it stays one column, which is
also what a landscape phone gets.

Each section screen gained an `embedded` mode: it keeps its title, because the
pane has to say which section it is, and drops the back arrow, because `canPop`
would answer for the Settings route still open on the left and tapping it would
leave Settings entirely.

**A section's own children stay in the pane too.** Personalization → custom
themes, About → licences: those open with `Navigator.of(context).push`, which
without a navigator in the pane resolves to the one above and takes over the
whole window, accesses and all. The pane has its own, keyed by section, so the
left stays the accesses, the right becomes the child, and its back arrow returns
to the section — and picking a different section starts at its own root rather
than inheriting where you had wandered in the last one.

### Fixed — the activity heatmap sat against the right edge on a wide screen

A `reverse: true` scroll view anchors its content to the **end** of the axis,
which is what makes the grid open on the most recent weeks when a year does not
fit. On a surface wide enough to hold the whole year it did the same thing with
nothing to scroll: the grid pressed against the right with a gap beside it,
complete but looking misaligned. It only reverses while the year does not fit.

### Fixed — menu glyphs read as disabled

The drawer menu's icons took the muted `onSurfaceVariant` while the label naming
the same action took `onSurface`, so the glyph sat a tone below its own label.
They also used the *subordinate* content size, which at 18 dp beside 15 pt text
reads as faint rather than as quiet. A menu row's glyph is the row's own mark:
it takes the row's size and the row's colour. Only a row that is genuinely quiet
— the back row — stays muted, and it is muted on both.

### Changed — the autonomous-mode banner setting is no longer named after Pi

Settings → Conversation grouped that toggle under **Pi Agent**. Pi was the only
agent running without per-action approval when it landed; it is not any more,
and a group named after one agent stops describing itself the day a second one
behaves the same. It is **Autonomous agents** now — named for the behaviour,
which is what the setting actually follows.

### Fixed — a project and its main folder were the same thing to the app

A repository is identified by its main worktree's path, which is **also** the
identity of the folder for that worktree. Collapse state is a set of those
strings, so the two rows shared one: tapping the main folder shut the entire
project, and keeping a project open with its folders closed was impossible. The
repository is now `repo:<path>` — two rows on screen need two identities.

### Changed — the wide layout replaces the pane instead of stacking on it

With a permanent drawer nothing is "somewhere you went": the drawer never moves
and what changes is the contents of a pane. Pushing there built a stack the
layout gives no way to see — open a conversation, walk into its git screen, pick
another conversation, and back retraced every screen ever glanced at. Opening
now **replaces** on wide windows and still pushes on a phone, decided in one
place rather than at the five call sites that open a conversation.

Two consequences that had to be handled explicitly:

- The file browser and git screens open with a raw `Navigator.push`, landing
  *above* the routed page — so `go` alone swapped the page underneath and left
  them covering it. From the file browser, picking another conversation looked
  like nothing happened. The shell's navigator is keyed and emptied first.
- "Back" from the pane's own first screen now **closes what is open** rather
  than popping: nothing was left behind to pop to.

### Changed — the drawer's footer carries the actions the phone keeps in its bar

Tapping the row returns the content pane to the overview and clears the stack
behind it — the way out of a deep walk without retracing it. Editing your
profile, settings and pairing moved into a menu beside it, pairing as a submenu
because it is two ways to do one thing.

The first version navigated while that menu was still open, which left its
barrier up with nothing to dismiss it: the app froze with a menu on screen and
no way out. It now records the choice, closes, and only then navigates.

### Fixed — the drawer moved when the *other* pane opened a keyboard

The keyboard consumes the bottom inset for the whole window, so the drawer's
`SafeArea` shrank and its profile row slid down while you typed in the content
pane. `maintainBottomViewPadding` keeps it still. A phone never showed this —
a phone has no drawer beside the keyboard.

### Added — the list says which conversation you are reading

Beside a permanent drawer the list never leaves the screen, and one that never
says which of its rows is open makes you hold the answer in your head. The open
row takes `secondaryContainer` — M3's own selected-item role, never a coloured
border, which reads as an error state at this size. Selection outranks the
unread tint: a conversation you have open cannot meaningfully still be asking
for attention.

Only in that layout. On a phone the open conversation **is** the screen, so
marking a row you cannot see while reading it would be marking nothing.

### Fixed — back still works after rotating a tablet into a phone shape

The wide layout replaces routes instead of stacking them, so rotating with a
conversation open left the narrow layout holding a stack of exactly one page.
The system gesture would have left the app from a screen you reached by tapping
into it, and the bar's own arrow did nothing at all — which reads as broken
rather than as a dead end. Both now walk the hierarchy the phone would have
built: a conversation belongs to its PC's list, everything else to the overview.

They go through **one** function. Two paths to the same stack is why the first
attempt fixed the gesture and left the arrow dead.

### Added — a permanent drawer on wide windows

On expanded windows and above (≥ 840 dp) the app stops being a stack of screens:
a permanent drawer holds the PC and its work, and the routed screen becomes the
pane beside it. **On a phone nothing changes** — the shell returns the screen
literally, so the existing stack and its back behaviour are untouched.

The route table stays flat; one `ShellRoute` wraps it and decides where a screen
renders. No second navigator and no branch per pane: a separate navigation model
for tablets would mean every deep link and push notification had to work twice.

The drawer is **three zones and nothing else** — the PC, its work, you. Zone 1
switches PCs with a real connection attempt (and its failure snackbar), and
*becomes* the pairing call to action when nothing is paired. Zone 2 is the
spaces tree unchanged, through a new `embedded` mode that drops the app bar,
the pull-to-refresh and the extended FAB. Zone 3 returns the content pane to the
overview — the "home" affordance of a layout with no back stack.

Which PC it shows is resolved by how much each source knows: the open
conversation's thread, then the last list visited (persisted), then the
connected PC. Without that, a push notification opening `/conversation/:id`
leaves the drawer blank.

Back with a drawer up empties the **content**, not the app: a deep link arrives
with nothing behind it, so without this the first back press closes an app
visibly full of your work.

### Fixed — MediaQuery is read by the property, not wholesale

Six widgets read `MediaQuery.of(context)` to get one field. That subscribes them
to every change — the keyboard opening, a rotation, a text-scale change — so a
bubble that only cares whether animations are disabled rebuilt on every keystroke
that moved the view insets. They now use `MediaQuery.disableAnimationsOf` /
`.sizeOf`, which subscribe to one thing each.

The conversation also measures its reading width from a `LayoutBuilder` rather
than the window: inside the drawer's content pane those differ by 320 dp, and
measuring the window would centre the text against space it does not own.

### Changed — every level of the list has its own ordering

The list grew a third level when worktrees started sitting under their project,
and the sort menu only had two — so the **worktrees inside a project could not
be ordered at all**: `buildWorkspaceTree` sorted them itself, out of reach of
any setting. It now takes a comparator, and the menu has a group per level.

All three take the same four orderings — `status`, `activity`, `created`,
`name` — from one shared `ListSort` rather than three near-identical enums that
would drift apart the first time one of them gained an option. `created` for a
project or a folder is derived, since the bridge reports a path and not a
history: it is the oldest conversation inside, which is when work there began.

The **archive gets fewer on purpose** (`created` and `name`): archived work is
finished by definition, so "needs attention" and "recent activity" would both
sort by a value that can no longer change.

**The menu cascades.** Every ordering for every level at once was seventeen
entries — a list that ran off the bottom of a phone, which is not a menu. Tapping
a level now opens its orderings **beside** the levels instead of replacing them:
a second `showMenu` pushed over the first without popping it, so nothing closes
under the next choice and a second level is one tap away. Dismissing the second
panel is "back", and costs no widget because a route stack already works that
way.

It is built from the app's own floating menu on purpose. An attempt with
`MenuAnchor` — the only Flutter widget with a built-in cascade — put a second
menu *system* in the app bar: a bare overlay beside routed menus, which opened
and closed differently and swallowed taps between them (with a routed menu up,
the barrier ate the tap and the sort button never saw it). A test now pins that
every panel is a routed menu.

Each level shows what it is sorted by on its own row, so the question this menu
usually gets asked is answered before opening anything — and it updates the
instant you choose. A `showMenu` builds its items once, so both that subtitle
and the second panel's tick would otherwise sit on the old value until the whole
menu was closed and reopened, contradicting the choice just made in it. With
only one level to order — the archive — there is no cascade at all.

The project level only appears when there is a project to order, so a PC whose
folders never group is not offered a control that moves nothing it can see. Items with nothing to sort on sink to a **stable** alphabetical tail
rather than reshuffling on every rebuild.

### Added — worktrees sit under the repository they belong to

The repository level is back, and this time it is real. `git/worktrees` tells
the phone which folders are worktrees of which repository, so they now sit under
it. It is never inferred from path prefixes — worktrees are **siblings** on
disk, so a shared prefix says nothing, and inferring it is what sank the first
attempt at this level.

Two rules keep it from repeating that failure: a repository node appears only
when it relates **two or more** folders (a heading over a single folder is
chrome, not structure), and a folder that relates to nothing stays exactly where
it is — there is no "other" bucket. The repository row carries no "+" of its
own, because a new conversation happens in a *folder*, and a repository with
three worktrees cannot answer which.

The table is built from the folders **on the list** — the distinct `cwd`s of
this PC's conversations — not from the bridge's configured roots.
`workspaceRoots` is optional and frequently empty (a conversation can be started
anywhere through the folder picker), and keying the query on it meant the
hierarchy silently never appeared for anyone who had not configured one. One
reply names every sibling of its repository, so ten worktrees of one repo cost
one call, not ten.

**An older bridge changes nothing.** It answers "method not found", the table
arrives empty, and the list is literally the flat one it was before — no error,
no guess. Nine tests cover the shapes, including that a shared path prefix is
still not a relationship, and that folders group with no configured roots at
all.

### Added — a folder says what its working tree is doing

Each folder row now reports what the desktop's sidebar reports: uncommitted
work, and how far it has drifted from its remote (`↑ahead`, `↓behind`). No new
contract was needed — `git/status` already returned all of it; what was missing
was a per-folder provider instead of a single stream for the open conversation.

The rules are about **cost**, not appearance. Fifteen folders on screen is
fifteen round trips to a PC that may be behind a relay, from a phone on a
battery. So: only while connected to that PC; only for folders whose indicators
are actually on screen (a collapsed folder draws none, so nothing is watched and
nothing is fetched); and at most one request per folder per 15 s. The refresh
that matters arrives on the existing `git/status` bus after a commit, push or
pull — the producer is already holding the new status, so re-asking the bridge
would be a round trip to learn nothing.

A zero is never drawn and the row caps at three signals; the breakdown — branch,
upstream, `+additions −deletions`, file count — is one long-press away. With no
answer the row draws **nothing**, never "clean": a folder we could not reach
reported as clean is a lie that looks exactly like good news. A folder on a PC
that went offline keeps its last known state, dimmed.

### Added — every screen the plan will not reach now arrives like the rest

The seven navigable screens no remaining phase names: the commit detail, and
Settings' deep screens — personalization, the custom-theme editor, the theme
manager, prompt templates and both licence screens. Their lists, grids and
sections rise into place like everywhere else.

That closes the gap for good. What is left without an entrance is left on
purpose and each has a reason: the **QR scanner** (a live camera preview, where
a fade reads as the camera failing), the **onboarding backdrop** (it is the
backdrop), and the floating agent marks (already animated). Every other screen
either has one or is named by a phase that will bring it under the same rule.

### Added — onboarding and the archive arrive like everything else

The last two screens with no motion. The archive's list rises row by row like
the active one.

Onboarding is a `PageView`, and there the one-frame window lands exactly where
it should without a rule of its own: at launch only page 0 is built, so its
hero, title and body rise in; every later page is built as you swipe to it — a
frame long past the window — so it arrives on the PageView's own slide, and no
rise fights that slide sideways. A test measures the assumption underneath
(that a `PageView` builds only the visible page) rather than trusting it.

### Changed — the archive stays a flat list, deliberately

It was the one screen the folder grouping did not reach, and it should not: the
active list groups because the question there is *where work is happening*,
while the archive answers *which one was it* — a retrieval question that a
search field and a date sort answer better than a hierarchy you have to expand.
Grouping would add a navigation step to a lookup. Recorded so the inconsistency
reads as a decision rather than as something missed.

### Added — profile, settings and manual pairing arrive like the rest of the app

The entrance now reaches the three screens that had **no motion at all**:
profile (staggered by block — the stats, the activity heatmap, then usage),
settings and its six section screens (staggered by row), and manual pairing.

Pairing takes a **single** entrance rather than a stagger: it is a form, and a
form arrives as one thing — staggering it would put a wait between the screen
opening and the field you came to type in. The **QR scanner is deliberately
left alone**: it is a live camera preview, and fading one in reads as the
camera failing.

`NeScaffold` is now itself an entrance scope, so a screen no longer wraps
anything — a row inside any of them just uses `NeEntranceRow`, and a fixed list
of children uses `NeEntranceScope.stagger([...])`. The four screens that had
been wrapping themselves stopped.

`docs/conventions.md` records the standing rule this settles: a screen you touch
leaves with the current design language — type from the scale and chosen by
meaning, motion where content arrives, sizes from tokens — and names the screens
(`onboarding/`, `archived_threads_screen.dart`) that no planned phase will sweep
up on its own.

### Added — lists rise into place the first time they fill

The home overview and the conversation list appeared fully formed, which for a
screen whose whole content arrives at once reads as a jump. Their rows now enter
with a short staggered fade-and-rise, reusing the entrance the conversation
timeline already had (`NeEnterTransition`, now with a delay) behind
`NeEntranceScope` / `NeEntranceRow`.

The window is **one frame**, not a duration. A sliver lays out everything the
viewport needs in a single pass, so "the rows that arrived together" and "the
rows built in one frame" are the same set — including when the data landed
asynchronously. Anything built in a later frame is a row you scrolled to, and
appears at once: what animates is the list arriving, never a row reached under
your thumb. Frames also make it testable, which a wall-clock window is not.

**Fixed along the way — an entrance was destroying its row's state.**
`NeEnterTransition` returned its bare child once the animation completed,
dropping two widgets from above it; Flutter treats that as a different subtree,
unmounts the child's element and builds a fresh one, so any `State` inside died
the instant the entrance ended. The new row wrapper had the same flaw in a
second form (it asked per build, and the window shuts after the first frame).
Both now keep a fixed shape. In the app this showed as a revealed IP address
quietly re-hiding itself — caught by an existing test, not by looking.

### Fixed — the app follows one type scale instead of two

`TextTheme` has fifteen slots and this theme defined five. That is not the same
as leaving ten unused: an unset slot falls back to **Material's own** value —
`titleLarge` 22/w400, `headlineSmall` 24/w400, `labelMedium` 12/w500 — which
belongs to M3's uncompressed reference scale, not to the compressed one this app
draws (a 32 sp hero, not 57). Around ninety call sites across thirty-four files
were reaching for those ten slots, so which ladder a screen followed depended on
which slots it happened to use. That is why density jumped between screens, and
why the home overview read as enormous beside the conversation list.

All fifteen are now set, and the middle is filled rather than the top lowered:
28, 24 and 22 above the existing 20, and 18 for a region or a card between it
and 16. Nothing that was already right moved.

What the completed scale would have changed on its own, and did not:

- **Top bars.** Six screens spelled their title `titleLarge.copyWith(fontSize:
  20)`, which rendered correctly only while `titleLarge` was undefined and
  resolved to Material's regular weight. Defining it would have emboldened every
  bar in the app at once. They now share `UxnanTypography.barTitle` (20/w400) —
  the reviewed style, in one place, unaffected by the ladder around it.
- **Markdown headings.** They need six strictly descending steps; the UI scale
  does not have six to spare, and two of its rungs share metrics on purpose. The
  ramp is remapped to 20/18/16/14/13/12.
- **Two heroes.** A full-screen dialog's title and a commit's subject both read
  `headlineSmall` when that meant 24; they take a headline rung rather than
  shrink to 18.

Raised where a title heads something rather than names a row: settings section
headers, a PC's name on its card, and every empty state — those sat at 14 under
a 48 dp glyph, which is what an empty screen says at all.

`test/widget/presentation/type_scale_test.dart` fails if a rung goes missing,
stops descending, stops being compressed, or lets a group and its rows share a
style.

### Added — the new-conversation button steps aside while you scroll

A FAB sits over the bottom-right of the list, which on a phone is exactly where
the rows you are scrolling toward arrive. While you are scrolling you are
reading, not acting, so it now shrinks away and returns the moment the list
settles — on the scroll's own end, not on a timer, so the wait is as long as the
scroll is and no longer, fling included. It stops accepting taps while it is
gone.

Opt-in per screen (`NeScaffold(hideFabOnScroll: true)`), because a FAB that is a
*scroll affordance* rather than an action — the conversation history's
back-to-top — exists precisely for the moment this would hide it.

The motion is the composer control ribbon's, now shared as `UxnanMotion.reveal`
(220 ms `easeOutCubic`) instead of living as loose numbers inside that one
widget. The app's spring tokens model a *press* — stiff, with a little
overshoot — and reused for something leaving the screen they read as a snap and
a bounce; the design guide now says so next to the spring table.

### Fixed — glyphs stroke at the weight the app was drawn around, and a group outranks its rows

Two things made the conversation list read thinner and flatter than the rest of
the app. Both were app-wide, not screen-deep.

**The icons were about a third too light.** Hugeicons authors its artwork at a
1.5 stroke where Material drew 2, and `UxIcon`'s optical scale — which keeps a
given size inking what it always inked — shrinks the artwork inside its box and
thinned that stroke a further ~13% as a side effect. Compounded, every glyph in
the app arrived far lighter than the Material one it replaced. `UxIcon` now
draws at `UxnanSize.iconStroke` (2 on the grid, ~1.74 after the scale), and a
test pins it. `uxnandesktop` keeps the vendor's 1.5: it draws smaller glyphs at
monitor distance, where the lighter stroke is correct.

**A folder and the conversations inside it were drawn identically** — both
`titleSmall`, 14/w500 — so a screen made entirely of rows had no hierarchy to
read. The theme had no rung between a screen's headline (20) and a single row
(14) to reach for, which is how it happened. `titleMedium` (16/w600) now exists
and is what a *group* is titled with; supporting lines step in parallel
(14/w400 under a group, 12/w400 under a row).

Content glyph sizes move with it: the folder that identifies a row takes the new
`iconContentLarge` (24), subordinate marks — the chevron, the state indicator —
go 16 → 18, and a folder's **+** is now an S button (40) rather than XS (32).
`docs/neural-expressive-design.md` records the scale the app actually ships, and
warns that the ten type slots it leaves undefined silently follow Material's
ladder instead of this one.

### Changed — a PC's conversations are grouped by the folder they run in

The screen was a flat list of every conversation on a PC. It now groups them by
the **folder** each one runs in, so twenty conversations across four checkouts
read as four things instead of twenty.

**One level, not two.** The desktop sidebar shows repositories over their
worktrees because it *knows* which is which; the phone does not — the bridge
reports a flat list of configured roots and nothing about worktrees, which live
as siblings of their repository. A project level built on that would have been a
heading over a single folder, plus a bucket named "other" holding most of the
real work. The folder is the top of the tree until the bridge can say more
(`git/worktrees`), at which point a project level can come back meaning what it
means on the desktop. Configured roots still contribute their **name**, which is
usually friendlier than a basename.

Paths are matched after normalising separators and case, so two spellings of one
folder are one row however they reached us — while the path shown and copied is
the one that was actually reported.

A folder row carries its name and, closed, the strongest state inside it —
hiding that would defeat the reason the screen exists. Its second line answers
what the fold hides: open, just how many conversations it holds, since each one
carries its own agent mark and state a row below; closed, the agents inside it
as well, because that evidence is gone. Everything else — the
full path, the conversations with their states, and the git state that lands
next — is one **long-press** away; the desktop shows the same on hover, and a
phone has no hover.

Each folder's **+** starts a conversation already in it, rather than in the
bridge's first root, which was almost never the one you meant.

The filter chips are gone. With the list grouped and two orderings available
they were a third way to answer a question the screen now answers by shape. The
sort menu grew to match: **folders** order by what needs attention, by recent
activity, or by name — and **conversations** order independently inside them.
Attention-first is the default, because the reason to open this screen is
usually "what happened", not "what exists".

The list stays flat internally (a typed row per line) rather than nesting
widgets, so a PC with hundreds of conversations builds the handful on screen.

Content glyphs got two size tokens (`UxnanSize.iconContent` 20,
`iconContentSmall` 16). The guide sized chrome and the composer but never these,
which is how they drifted between 13 and 18 dp across the app; it now has a
table for them, and for the XS button a row-level action uses.

### Added — a conversation says what its agent is actually doing

The list showed a spinner or a dot: running, or not. It now shows the same five
states the desktop sidebar does — **working · waiting for you · blocked · done ·
idle** — so you can tell from the list which conversation needs you, instead of
opening three to find out.

The states are the desktop's; **how they are known is not.** The desktop app
owns the terminals its agents run in and reads a hook server, a terminal title
and PTY activity. The phone owns none of that, so this is derived from what the
bridge already sends: turn events, queue state, sign-in status, unread replies,
and the approval/question blocks the agent emits when it stops to ask.

Those blocks are the interesting half. They arrive for **every** thread, not
just the open one, so `ThreadManager` now tracks which threads are holding on an
unanswered question — which is the only reason a list can distinguish "working"
from "waiting for you" at all. It clears when the user answers or when the turn
ends, and rebuilds on the next resync, since `turn/list` replays the same
blocks.

Precedence is the design: **waiting** outranks **working**, because an agent
that asked and stopped is the one thing worth interrupting someone for, and it
outranks **blocked** too. A signed-out agent blocks a thread even while idle
(its next turn cannot run) but not an archived one; a held queue only blocks
while something is still queued. `errored` and `stale` ride alongside as
modifiers rather than states, because "the last turn failed" and "it is working
again" are both true and the row should not have to pick one.

Each state draws a **different shape**, not just a different tint: colour alone
is not a channel every reader has, and this mark is often the only thing telling
two identical rows apart. `idle` deliberately keeps a plain dot — it is by far
the most common state, and a glyph there would be constant noise. A claim that
has gone quiet for 30 minutes is dimmed rather than dropped: the turn may still
be alive, and hiding it would be the bigger lie.

The row itself was rebuilt to read the way the desktop's does: **state, then
who, then what** — the status mark, then the agent's own mark a step larger,
then the title with its second line beneath. The 44 dp framed avatar is gone: it
was the loudest thing in a row whose point is the text beside it.

Agent marks lost their border and their drop shadow. `AgentLogo` draws one bare
for dense rows, and the framed `AgentLogoChip` — still used where an agent is an
object you pick, the onboarding hero and the picker — is flat now too. The
shadow was also the reason the thread card looked elevated: the card itself has
no elevation, and what read as its shadow was the chip's, cast from inside it.

The row's second line follows the state. "Waiting for you" wins over the agent's
last words; only once nothing is pending does the reply take the line back.


### Changed — the app draws Hugeicons, like the desktop and the website

Mobile was the last surface still on Material Icons. It now uses the same free
**stroke-rounded Hugeicons** set the desktop app and the website draw, so a
concept looks the same wherever you meet it.

The official Flutter package is not a drop-in, and the differences shaped the
migration: its icons are SVG path data (`List<List<dynamic>>`), not `IconData`
with a code point. So `find.byIcon` cannot see them, `IconData` fields had to
become `UxIconData`, and `HugeIcon` — which has no `semanticLabel` and sizes
itself to a hard-coded 24 — is never used directly.

Two pieces carry all of it. **`UxIcon`** is the only widget that talks to the
package, restoring the semantic label an icon-only control is required to have
and the sizing an ambient `IconTheme` is supposed to give it. **`UxIcons`** is a
catalogue naming all 173 glyphs for what they MEAN, so choosing one stays a
design decision made in one reviewable file rather than a constant pasted across
sixty; tests match on those constants through `findUxIcon`.

Six icons changed **meaning**, not just style, because Material never had the
glyph and the app had been borrowing a metaphor: branches and routes were a
call-split arrow and now are **GitBranch**; commits, merges and diffs are
**GitCommit**, **GitMerge** and **GitCompare**; an agent was a toy robot and is
now **Robot01**; the terminal is **ComputerTerminal01**.

Icons arrive at the size the layout expects. Hugeicons paints its artwork edge
to edge, so at the same nominal `size` a glyph inked **~15% larger** than the
Material one it replaced — measured from pixels: Material inks 0.750 of its box
(the 18-in-24 live area), Hugeicons 0.862. `UxIcon` corrects that with one
factor, and keeps the widget's own footprint at the full size so nothing
reflows. A test reads the pixels back at four sizes, so a package upgrade that
changes the viewBox cannot slip through.

Each network path now shows its own glyph on the device card — router for LAN, a
shield for Tailscale, a link for direct, a cloud for the relay — through the
same mapping the transport badge uses. One generic aerial for all four told the
reader nothing.

Flutter's full-screen `SearchAnchor` draws its own back arrow from the Material
set unless one is supplied; the three search views now supply ours. It was the
one place a Material glyph survived, because the framework builds it rather
than us.

Comparing the packages' path data — rather than trusting their names — caught
three more: `arrow_back` and `arrow_downward` were landing on the *chevron*
variant (one V-shaped stroke, no shaft) instead of a real arrow, and
`block` was rendering a plain ✕ rather than the circle-with-slash it means. The
free set is stroke-only, so Material's outline-vs-filled check-circle
distinction collapses to one glyph; nothing else was lost.


### Changed — the home screen is a real overview, not a list with a title

The first screen was a list of paired PCs under a "Devices" title, with the
brand mark pinned in a footer at the bottom.

The bar now carries the **product's** identity rather than the screen's: the
mark on the left, standing a little taller than the action circles beside it,
and your avatar on the right (tapping it opens the profile). The footer is
gone — the logo was spending the bottom of every screen on itself.

Under the bar, the screen opens with a headline in two rows — the constant
greeting quiet and small, your name below it carrying the weight — over two
badges: how many machines are reachable, and since when you have been using
Uxnan. It scrolls away under the pinned bar rather than collapsing into a title;
the bar already holds the mark and the avatar, and repeating "Welcome back" up
there would say nothing. Every fragment is dropped rather than faked: without a
name the greeting becomes the whole headline, and a phone that has never synced
metrics omits the date badge.

That date is read from the metrics **cache** (`memberSinceProvider`) rather than
through `profileMetricsProvider` — the latter falls back to aggregating the
whole local database, which is the right price for the profile screen and far
too much for one date on the app's first screen.

**Each PC card was rebuilt around a labelled metadata strip**: three
equal-weight cells — last seen, connection, address — each with a small caption
over its value, parted by hairlines drawn at a third of the outline tone. A full
`outlineVariant` rule cut the card in two and fought the calm surface a card is
supposed to be; the strip needs a seam, not a border. The same facts were there before as
stacked lines that read like a paragraph; a labelled cell is scannable, so you
look at the one column you care about instead of reading the card. Status and
network path now share one cell, because they are one fact seen from two sides:
the live path (`LAN`, `Tailscale`, `Direct`, `Relay`) when there is one,
otherwise what the connection is doing. That mapping is shared with the
transport badge (`networkKindLabel`), so a rename cannot leave the two
disagreeing. The machine glyph carries a live status dot in its corner, and the
name's subtitle is what the PC is holding: **agents working right now** and
**how many conversations** the phone knows for it, both from the local cache so
they survive having no connection. A count of zero draws nothing.

Only threads explicitly tagged with that PC count. An untagged legacy thread is
shown under every PC while browsing, which is right, but counting it under every
PC would inflate each card by the same threads.

**Icon Surfaces are 44 dp now** (22 dp glyph, `UxnanSize.iconSurface`), keeping
the 48 dp touch target: at the old 40/20 they read as small change beside the
product mark and gave the thumb less to aim at. The guide now records 44/22 as
the default and 40/20 as the small variant for dense rows. The overview's avatar
action matches, so the bar is one rhythm.

**Every floating menu got its type back.** `popupMenuTheme` styled the surface
but never set `textStyle`, so items fell back to `labelLarge` — a style this
theme does not define — and rendered in Flutter's default font, a size below the
surfaces around them. They now use `UxnanTypography.menuItem` (15/w500) and open
at a shared minimum width, so two entries and six look like the same component.

**`NeMenuButton`** joins `IconSurfaceMenu` as the second and last menu trigger:
chrome wears the filled circle, in-content triggers do not, and both open the
identical themed menu.

On windows wide enough for a side pane the cards pair up into two columns of
equal height. They are laid out as rows of paired cells rather than a
`SliverGrid`, because a grid needs a fixed extent or aspect ratio and this
card's height follows text that grows with the user's font scale — the one input
a fixed extent cannot survive.

### Changed — the profile screen stops repeating itself

Its identity card (avatar, name, member-since, PC count) was a duplicate of the
overview's header, one screen deeper — so it is gone, and **Edit profile** moved
into a new overflow menu in the bar.

The **Backup** card went with it: export and import are actions taken once in a
while, not information worth permanent screen space, so they are menu entries
too. They stay disabled while no PC is connected — the bridge is what seals and
verifies the file — with the reason spelled out in the menu instead of left for
the user to deduce from a greyed row. The note the card carried, about stats
being lost without a backup, now rides in the export dialog, where it is read at
the moment it matters.

### Added — the app knows how wide its window is

`UxnanBreakpoint` (`presentation/theme/breakpoints.dart`) implements the five
window classes the Neural Expressive guide has always specified but the code
never had: compact / medium / expanded / large / extra-large, each carrying its
lateral margin, its content clamp and its side-pane width. It is the single
place that turns a width into a layout decision — no screen compares raw widths
any more.

`NeScaffold` gained `constrainContent` (on by default): past 840 dp its content
stops growing and the surplus becomes margin, so a list no longer stretches an
entire tablet row. It is a **no-op below expanded** — the inset is 0 there — so
phones render exactly what they rendered before. The chrome is deliberately
excluded: the top bar still spans the full row, as the conversation's already
did.

`TwoPaneScaffold` (`presentation/screens/shell/app_shell_screen.dart`, until now
an unused stub) lays a side pane beside a detail surface on windows that fit
one, and is a pass-through everywhere else. It resolves its breakpoint from its
**own constraints** rather than the window, because it is meant to nest: with a
side pane already taken out, the window's width says nothing about the space a
split inside the content actually has.

Nothing is wired to a route yet — this is the foundation the adaptive layout is
built on, landing on its own so it can be verified in isolation.

### Changed

- Removed the Gemini-specific compatibility filters from threads, agents,
  metrics and provider usage now that the shared/bridge contract no longer
  exposes the standalone Gemini CLI. Generic unknown/deprecated-agent handling
  remains unchanged.

## [0.0.18-alpha.20260805] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed — the thread row shows the agent's latest reply, not its first

The row's second line was pinned to whatever the agent answered on the very
first turn and never changed again.

The cause was a doc that lied: `IMessageRepository.getMessages` promised
"most recent first", but the implementation pages the newest N and returns them
**ascending**, so walking that list forward finds the *oldest* reply in the
window. The traversal is fixed and the interface doc now states the real order,
so the next reader is not misled the same way.

Same symptom, second cause: a `FutureProvider` resolves once per key and caches,
so even a correct traversal would have frozen on the first result. The key now
carries the thread's activity timestamp, giving each turn its own.

### Fixed — streaming replies feel fast again, with the formatting kept

Rendering Markdown as the text arrives (instead of after the turn) made replies
visibly slower, and the cost was real rather than imagined: **every delta
rebuilt the whole timeline and re-parsed the entire reply**, so a turn cost time
quadratic in its own length.

Deltas are now coalesced, and the window **grows with the reply** — which is
where the cost is. A fixed one-frame window turned out to be the wrong shape:
agents emit a delta roughly every 20 ms, so almost nothing fell inside it.
Measured on a realistic 6000-character reply (prose, list, inline code, fenced
block) arriving as 1500 deltas:

| rebuilds | cost |
|---|---|
| one per delta (1500) | 18.9 s |
| one per frame, 16 ms (~1500) | 16.0 s |
| 50 ms (600) | 6.7 s |
| **100 ms (300)** | **3.4 s** |

Nothing is dropped and nothing waits for the turn to end: whatever lands inside
the window is rendered together on the next frame, still fully formatted, so the
text still appears as it streams. A short reply keeps the shortest window and
stays maximally responsive; only a long one throttles, and only to a rate no eye
resolves as discrete. Deltas alone coalesce — a completed turn, a content block
or a re-sync still renders immediately.

### Fixed — the queued bubble's dashes are the bubble's own edge

The outline read as a second rectangle drawn on top of the bubble, because that
is what it was: a widget painting over whatever box it wrapped — and that box
carried a vertical margin, so the dashes were stroked around the margin instead
of around the bubble.

It is now a `ShapeBorder` on the bubble's own decoration, so it is stroked on
exactly the shape being filled and cannot drift from it, and it animates with
the rest of the decoration rather than independently.

### Fixed — the reasoning-effort menu is no longer trapped under the keyboard

Entering a conversation focuses the composer, so the keyboard is up. The effort
button sits directly above it and the menu is anchored to that button, which put
the menu underneath the keyboard and out of reach. `requestFocus: false` had
been added so the menu would not close the keyboard — but the keyboard is the
problem, so that is what kept the bug.

Tapping the button now drops focus and waits for the viewport to settle before
anchoring, so the menu opens in the space the keyboard vacated. The anchor is
measured after the wait (the button moves down as the keyboard collapses), the
wait is bounded so a platform that reports no inset cannot hang the tap, and the
composer's text is untouched — only its keyboard is dismissed.

Mobile suite **839 passing**.


## [0.0.17-alpha.20260804+20260804] - 2026-08-04

### Changed — a queued message can now reach the agent without waiting

On agents whose CLI has an input channel mid-turn (Claude Code, OpenCode,
Codex, pi), a message sent while the agent works is handed to it **inside the
running turn** instead of waiting for the turn to end — the way those CLIs
behave when you type at them mid-task. Everything the queue already did is
unchanged; the message simply stops waiting when it doesn't have to.

- The queued bubble stays where it was: pinned below the timeline, with its
  edit and cancel actions in reach, until it is actually handed over. Nothing
  about that placement changed.
- **The queued bubble is now an ordinary bubble with a dashed outline** rather
  than a muted "ghost" showing one ellipsized line. It keeps the user's own
  tone and its whole message, and only its edge says "not sent yet"; on
  delivery the dashes dissolve in place. New `NeDashedOutline` widget
  (`presentation/widgets/ne_dashed_outline.dart`).
- Handles the new `stream/turn/delivered`: the bubble settles into a sent
  message and stops offering edit/cancel, because the agent already has it.
  Mostly a no-op on the device that sent it (`turn/send` already answers
  `delivered: true`); it matters for a second phone on the same thread and for
  a reconnect that restored the message from a pre-hand-off queue snapshot.
- Agents without that channel (Antigravity, Zero, Grok) are untouched: their
  follow-ups keep waiting for the current turn, exactly as before.

Tests: 3 new pixel-level tests for the dashed outline (it rasterizes the
widget and reads the image back — a test that only pumped would pass on an
outline that paints nothing, or on a solid border) plus one for the new
notification. Mobile suite **831 passing**.

## [0.0.16-alpha.20260803+20260803] - 2026-08-03

### Added — agent file links open in the workspace viewer

- Assistant Markdown links, bare local paths and inline-code file references
  are tappable in settled and streaming responses. They open the existing file
  viewer rather than leaving the conversation for another app.
- Link resolution happens on the paired PC. Relative paths start at the
  conversation cwd, while absolute paths and `..` references can resolve into
  a sibling worktree; the viewer receives that target's Git root and relative
  path, so a conversation rooted in X can open a file produced in Y.
- Remote links keep the existing safe copy behavior. Missing, non-file,
  `.git`, and sensitive targets produce a recoverable message instead of
  navigating.
- Path detection leaves the rest of a response alone: a bare hostname
  (`www.example.com/docs/x.md`) stays a web link, a fenced code block keeps its
  code-block styling, and inline code that isn't a path (`npm run build`) is
  not tappable.

### Fixed — streamed responses render Markdown immediately

- Assistant prose now uses the shared `MarkdownBody` renderer while tokens are
  still arriving, so completed emphasis, headings, lists, links and other
  Markdown no longer flash as source syntax and then restyle when the turn
  settles.
- The live activity loader remains beside the rendered block without becoming
  part of the selectable response. Settled and streaming prose now share the
  same Markdown style sheet and visual path.

### Changed — expanded turn controls use the full phone-width ribbon

- The conversation ribbon keeps its existing default: the effort/permission
  controls stay folded on the left while edit, token and context indicators
  remain visible on the right.
- Expanding the left controls now slides, fades and collapses the read-only
  indicators out of the row, preventing compact-phone crowding; folding the
  controls restores them with the inverse M3E transition. Reduced-motion users
  get the same state change without animation.

### Added — conversations follow turns written in native agent clients

- While a connected conversation is open and idle, Mobile re-syncs its newest
  page every three seconds. Completed turns written in Codex Desktop/CLI,
  OpenCode Desktop, Claude Code, pi, Zero or Grok appear without reopening the
  screen; opening, reconnecting and app resume keep their existing immediate
  re-sync paths.
- Re-sync now persists native-only user prompts as well as assistant replies.
  It matches a Mobile-authored prompt by turn id, preserving its local UUID,
  attachments and delivery state instead of creating a duplicate.
- Polls are deduplicated across navigation/reconnect/resume, pause while a
  bridge turn is live, stop when disconnected, and settle before the manager
  closes its streams.
- This is completed-turn convergence, not token streaming from another client.
  Antigravity has no reliable readable native transcript and is intentionally
  unchanged.

### Fixed — preserve every response produced during a turn

- Assistant progress/commentary no longer disappears when a terminal event
  carries only the agent's final native message. Live finalization and bridge
  re-sync now reconcile additively, retaining ordered prose and work blocks.
- Settled turns with multiple native assistant messages show a localized
  **N previous messages** divider. Earlier messages are collapsed by default
  and expand in place; while the agent is streaming they remain fully visible.
- Added durable response-boundary decoding so the disclosure survives app and
  bridge restarts. Codex supplies exact commentary/final phases; Claude Code and
  Pi supply their native message boundaries.

### Added — context-compaction milestones in conversations

- The conversation timeline now renders a quiet, localized **Context compacted**
  milestone exactly where the bridge persisted the event. It explains the
  reported cause and, when available, the approximate before/after token count.
- `CompactionContent` round-trips through the existing polymorphic content codec
  and stays out of response copy, previews and fingerprints because it is
  timeline metadata rather than assistant prose.

### Changed — Gemini has no mobile product surface

- Removed the Gemini agent enum branch, visual metadata, color, logo asset and
  usage-provider card. The application boundary filters both new
  `deprecated:true` descriptors and the legacy `gemini-cli` wire id, including
  cached threads and profile activity, so older bridges cannot make Gemini
  reappear.
- Antigravity remains the supported Google agent.

### Added — a workspace viewer that understands project documentation

- Expanded the file viewer from text, basic Markdown, and raster images to a
  capability-based preview surface for Markdown, animated GIF, SVG, and PDF on
  both Android and iOS. SVG keeps Preview / Source / Changes parity, so it can
  be inspected visually without giving up editing or git review.
- Markdown now resolves workspace-relative images and file links against the
  open document, including `../` paths and GitHub-style `?raw=true` suffixes.
  Local resources still travel through the bridge's guarded workspace RPCs;
  paths that would escape the workspace are rejected.
- Added a constrained README HTML compatibility pass for common centered
  headings, links, badges, images, line breaks, and presentational containers.
  Image width/height hints survive conversion, shields remain compact, fenced
  code stays untouched, and executable or embedded HTML is removed.
- Markdown images now use one reusable renderer for local and HTTPS raster,
  animated GIF, and SVG resources, with bounded layout and compact failure
  states instead of allowing a malformed asset to break the document.
- Added focused unit and widget regressions for format classification, safe
  path resolution, HTML normalization, fenced-code preservation, relative SVG
  badges, animated GIF delivery, and SVG Preview / Source switching.

### Changed — PDF bytes are delivered without lossy text decoding

- Added `pdfrx` for an in-app, pinch-zoomable PDF surface backed by PDFium on
  Android and iOS. The bridge now deterministically returns `.pdf` files as
  base64, even when their initial bytes happen to look like UTF-8, with a
  bounded 20 MiB PDF read limit.

### Added — the Markdown preview now follows GitHub's own rendering

- **GitHub alerts.** `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`
  and `> [!CAUTION]` render as titled, colour-coded callouts with their own
  icon (title localized EN/ES) instead of a blockquote that printed the
  `[!NOTE]` keyword as body text. A quote that is not an alert is untouched.
- **`<details>` disclosures fold again.** The summary is a tappable row and the
  body stays collapsed until opened, honouring `<details open>`. Previously both
  were flattened, so "hidden" content was always visible under a stray line.
- **HTML tables become real tables.** Rectangular, span-free `<table>` markup is
  rewritten as a pipe table rather than flattened into one line per cell.
- **Fenced code is syntax-highlighted and scrolls horizontally**, sharing the
  highlighter with the full-file source view; a long line is reachable instead
  of clipped at the content width.
- **Task lists show their state** (`- [x]` is a checked box, `- [ ]` an empty
  one), and `:emoji:` shortcodes, autolinks and heading anchors are enabled via
  the `gitHubWeb` extension set.
- **`<kbd>`, `<sub>` and `<sup>`** map onto inline code and Unicode
  subscripts/superscripts, so `H<sub>2</sub>O` reads as H₂O. A `<kbd>` wrapping
  content (an agent logo and its name, as READMEs use it) keeps that content
  rather than printing its Markdown.
- **A web link opens the browser.** Tapping an `http`/`https`/`mailto`
  destination hands it to the OS like any reader would, instead of only copying
  it. Workspace-relative links still open in the viewer, and anything that
  cannot be launched — an in-page anchor, an unusual scheme, a device with no
  handler — still lands on the clipboard, so a document can never make the
  phone open an arbitrary scheme.

### Fixed — README shields render instead of breaking the document

- **Remote Markdown resources are now typed by their response, not their URL.**
  Badge services answer extensionless endpoints
  (`img.shields.io/github/stars/…`) with `image/svg+xml`, so picking a decoder
  from the path sent SVG markup to the platform raster decoder: every shield in
  a README failed to decode and collapsed into a broken-image placeholder. They
  are fetched once through a shared loader (`RemoteResourceService`) that
  resolves the media type from `content-type` plus the payload's own signature,
  keeps `https`-only and a 5 MiB ceiling, and caches by URL so repainting a
  document never refetches a badge.
- **Shields are legible.** Every badge service emits its label as SVG text at
  ten times the size, scaled back down by a `transform` — and the SVG engine the
  app used for its own logos silently ignores transforms on `<text>`, so the
  label was painted ten times too large and buried the badge it belonged to.
  Workspace and Markdown SVG now render through `jovial_svg`, which honours it;
  the app's bundled logos keep their existing renderer.
- **A bolded sentence broken by `<br>` renders bold.** A `<br>` at the end of a
  source line emitted its own newline on top of the line's, leaving a blank line
  that ended the paragraph — so emphasis opened before the break never closed
  and the text showed its literal `**`. It now maps to Markdown's hard break and
  absorbs the following newline; a `<br>` before a genuinely blank line still
  starts a new paragraph.
- **A failed or loading badge no longer overflows its line.** Inline media is
  constrained to a shield's height, which is shorter than the padded icon +
  caption placeholder; that column overflowed by 20 px and painted the striped
  layout banner over the document. Both placeholders now measure their slot and
  degrade to a single glyph when the padded box does not fit.

### Added — send follow-up messages while the agent is working

The agent CLIs all let you keep typing while they work; the app made you wait
for the turn to end. Now a message sent during a live turn joins the thread's
queue and runs on its own when the current turn finishes. The queue lives on the
**bridge**, not here — it has to drain with the app backgrounded or closed,
which is the whole point of sending something and pocketing the phone.

- **A floating "Queue message" action above the composer**, shown only when it
  means something: a draft is waiting AND the thread is busy. The composer's own
  button is untouched — Send/Stop as always — and Enter still inserts a newline,
  so drafting a multi-line message (physical keyboard included) works exactly as
  before.
- **One control at a time above the composer.** The floating slot holds
  jump-to-latest when the user has scrolled up, the queue action when a draft is
  waiting on a busy thread, and otherwise nothing — with the turn-context shelf
  visible underneath, as before. The three never stack.
- **Queued messages are pinned to the bottom of the timeline** — below the reply
  still streaming — for as long as they wait, because they are not part of the
  conversation yet. Each is a soft elevated bubble rather than the user's
  primary tone, shows **one truncated line**, carries an **X** in its top-right
  corner and says where it sits in line ("Next in the queue", "2 in the queue").
  When the queue reaches one it settles into its full normal bubble, filed at
  the point where it was actually **delivered** — not where it was typed, which
  would place it above the previous turn's reply.
- **Two corner actions, deliberately different.** **Edit** (pencil) withdraws
  the message from the queue and puts its text back in the composer, leaving
  **no trace** in the timeline — it is about to be re-typed, so a husk beside it
  would be noise. **Cancel** (X) only drops it from the queue and leaves the
  normal bubble marked with a warning-toned "Message cancelled" note; nothing
  goes back to the composer. Either way the queue moves on to the next message.
- **Saved drafts live behind a Drafts action**, left of the queue button, rather
  than a card permanently over the conversation. Editing a queued message while
  the composer already holds text saves that text as a draft — so several
  queued messages can be edited without ever losing one. The action opens the
  **`/` palette's own card** (`ComposerPaletteCard`, now shared by `@`, `/` and
  drafts instead of three near-identical surfaces): two lines per draft, tap to
  restore, per-row delete, and a clear-all in the header behind a destructive
  confirmation. A draft only returns to an **empty** composer, so recovering
  text can never destroy the text being written.
- **One slot, three states, one rhythm.** The strip above the pill holds
  jump-to-latest (whenever the reader has scrolled up — it always wins), else
  the queue actions (Drafts whenever drafts exist, "Queue message" whenever
  sending would queue; either appears without the other), else nothing, with the
  turn-context shelf visible underneath. Saved drafts stay reachable even when
  there is nothing to queue. Composer chrome that floats above the pill from
  outside it now reproduces the pill's own 16 dp gutter (`_Centered`) and sits
  8 dp above it, so the palettes, banners and shortcuts stop each having their
  own width and spacing.
- **No snackbar on a successful hand-off.** It covered the composer at exactly
  the moment the user was meant to look at it — hiding the text the action had
  just put there, which read as the action having failed. The text appearing in
  the pill is the confirmation. Only the *refusal* still speaks, because nothing
  visible happens and the reason is not on screen.
- **A paused-queue banner** above the composer after you stop a turn (or one
  fails) with messages still waiting: the bridge holds them rather than firing
  them at a stopped agent, and the banner offers *Send them* / *Discard*.
- **Survives everything the live view already survives**: a resync re-reads
  `queuedTurnIds` / `queuePaused` from `turn/list` and settles each waiting
  bubble against the bridge's own view — still queued, ran, or cancelled — so a
  message whose fate we missed while backgrounded never stays a ghost. A queue
  changed from another device converges the same way.
- **Gated on the bridge actually supporting it** (`bridge/status` →
  `features.messageQueue`, via `bridgeSupportsQueueProvider`). Against an older
  bridge the action is hidden and sending stays blocked during a turn, exactly
  as before — offering it there would make that bridge start a second
  *concurrent* turn, which kills the running one (verified live: the running
  OpenCode turn stopped and the follow-up's reply was cut short).

### Fixed — the app no longer promises an immediate send it can't keep

Reopening the app with a turn still running left a window where the thread
merely *looked* idle: the live in-flight state lives in the bridge process and
only reaches the phone with the first `turn/list`. Sending in that window was
always safe — the bridge queues regardless of what the client believes — but the
button said "Send", so a message the bridge was about to queue was announced as
going out now.

A thread's in-flight state is now explicitly **unknown** until the bridge
confirms it (`ThreadManager.isTurnStateKnown`, reset on every reconnect since a
new connection can be a different bridge process), and the composer treats
unknown as **possibly busy**. The two mistakes are not symmetric: hedging toward
busy on an idle thread costs nothing (the action reads "Queue message", the tap
runs immediately anyway), while hedging toward idle is the one that misleads.
The bridge's *capability* is the one thing still never assumed — offering to
queue where it cannot would start a concurrent turn.

### Fixed — the composer keeps its text when chrome appears above it

`ComposerBar` had no key while everything above it in the same `Column` is
conditional (banners, the context shelf, the drafts palette, the attachment
strip). It survives today only because Flutter also matches children from the
end of the list and the composer is last — a property nothing was enforcing. It
now carries a stable key, so it cannot silently remount with a fresh empty
controller (and discard what is being typed) the day something is added below
it.

### Fixed — `bridge/status` is re-read on every (re)connect

It was keyed only on the connected device, so pointing the app at a different
bridge on the same PC (restarting it, swapping the build) kept answering with
whatever the first handshake reported. Harmless for the transport indicator it
originally fed; not harmless now that the same response decides which optional
features the app offers. It watches the connection phase too, and short-circuits
before that watch when nothing is connected so it never spins up the session
coordinator just to answer "not connected".
- **Two ordering fixes the queue exposed.** The live streaming message is
  anchored to `max(orderIndex) + 1`, so storing a queued message pushed the
  reply below it and re-sorted the view mid-turn; queued messages now render
  from their own pinned band and `_nextOrderIndex` reads the persisted messages
  instead of the rendered timeline (which carries synthetic indices). And the
  delivery-state writes that `stream/turn/cancelled` and `stream/queue/updated`
  both make are now serialized — running concurrently, the loser could overwrite
  the winner and a cancelled message came back as merely "sent".
- **Motion instead of jumps.** Timeline messages fade and lift into place
  (`NeEnterTransition`, one-shot per widget then a pass-through, so scrolling a
  long thread is unaffected); a queued bubble cross-fades its one-line preview
  into the full message on delivery, its corner actions fade with it, and the
  status line under it grows rather than snapping; the drafts palette opens and
  closes with an `AnimatedSize`; and `NePillButton` animates its tone between
  idle, selected and emphasized. All of it honors `disableAnimations`.
- New `MessageDeliveryState.queued` / `.cancelled`, `ThreadQueueState`,
  `threadQueueForProvider`, `BridgeStatus.supportsMessageQueue`,
  `ComposerHandoff` (+ `RescuedDraft`), `ComposerPaletteCard`,
  `RescuedDraftsCard`, `NeEnterTransition`, `IMessageRepository.deleteMessage`,
  and `stream/queue/updated` + `stream/turn/cancelled` decoding. EN/ES strings.
  33 new tests (759 total).

### Fixed — a row written by another build no longer takes the conversation down

- Opening a conversation threw `Invalid argument (name): No enum value with that
  name: "cancelled"` and left the screen dead. The local drift database outlives
  any single build of the app: a device that ran the message-queue build carries
  rows with `deliveryState: cancelled`, a value the current enum doesn't know,
  and `EnumByName.byName` throws inside the `watchMessages` stream — so the
  whole timeline (not just that message) failed to decode.
- Enum decoding from the local database is now **tolerant** (`byNameOr`, in the
  new `core/extensions/enum_ext.dart`), applied to the message repository
  (`role`, `deliveryState`) and the thread repository (`syncState`, `status`).
  An unrecognized value logs once and degrades: unknown role → `system` (a
  neutral block), unknown delivery state → `delivered` (the row exists, so the
  honest default is "it is in the history", never "it failed"), unknown sync →
  `behind` (self-correcting: it triggers a catch-up), unknown status → `active`
  (a thread is never silently hidden). Downgrades, branch builds and rollbacks
  now read a newer database instead of crashing on it.
- `cancelled` itself is a **known** state as of this same version (it ships with
  the message queue above), so the value that exposed the hole no longer takes
  the tolerant path. The hardening stays and is what it was always about: the
  *next* value written by a build this one has never seen.

### Changed — image attachments live inside the composer, and stay small once sent

- **Pending attachments moved into the pill.** The separate box that used to sit
  *above* the composer is gone: the thumbnails now render **inside** the
  composer, above the text field, in a row that scrolls horizontally once it
  outgrows the pill. Each keeps its own ✕ to drop just that image. Thumbnails
  are **56 dp** (down from 72 dp) so queuing an image grows the composer only a
  little, and the pill **morphs from its stadium ends into a 24 dp rounded
  surface** while attachments are present — the same task-specific morph the git
  commit composer already used — so the thumbnails aren't eaten by the round
  corners.
- **The picker takes several images at once.** The photo-library action now uses
  a multi-selection (`pickMultiImage`); the camera still captures one. The queue
  is capped at **10 images per message** (each rides inline as base64 on
  `turn/send`), with a snackbar when the cap is reached.
- **Sent images no longer blow the bubble open.** A user message renders its
  images as the same small strip **above** the bubble — right-aligned, scrolling
  horizontally when there are several — instead of full-size blocks stacked
  inside it under the text, so a long prompt keeps its collapsed preview and the
  timeline stays scannable. An **image-only message drops the bubble entirely**:
  the strip *is* the message. Tapping a thumbnail opens the image **full size**
  (pinch-zoom, swipe between the message's images).
- A new shared `ImageThumbStrip` widget backs both ends, so an attachment looks
  identical before and after it is sent, and a new `UxnanRadius.xxl` (24 dp)
  token carries the composer morph.
- New strings (EN + ES): `composerAttachLimit`, `attachmentImage`,
  `attachmentRemove`.

## [0.0.14-alpha.20260724+20260724] - 2026-07-24

### Changed — the Claude "latest" toggle now covers four aliases, not three

- The bridge advertises a new `fable` alias (`Fable (latest)`) alongside
  `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`, so the Settings → Models toggle copy was updated in
  **EN and ES**: *"List the **Fable**, Opus, Sonnet and Haiku “(latest)” aliases
  in the model picker."* / *"Muestra los alias «(latest)» de **Fable**, Opus,
  Sonnet y Haiku…"*. No logic changed — the picker renders `agent/models`
  generically and the toggle still filters on `isLatestAlias`, so the new alias
  and the newly seeded concrete models (Opus 5, Opus 4.6/4.5, Sonnet 4.5) appear
  with no app update. Doc comments naming the alias set were corrected to match.

### Fixed — push notifications now show the Uxnan mark instead of a white square

- Added a dedicated **monochrome status-bar icon** (`ic_stat_uxnan`, a white
  silhouette of the brand mark on transparency, at all five densities
  `drawable-mdpi…xxxhdpi`). Android keeps only a small icon's alpha channel, so
  the previous full-colour launcher icon rendered as a blank white square. Both
  notification paths now use it: the **foreground** path
  (`flutter_local_notifications`) passes the bare drawable name plus a brand
  accent, and the **background/killed** path gets new FCM manifest meta-data
  (`default_notification_icon`, `default_notification_color` →
  `@color/notification_color` `#1B6EF3`, `default_notification_channel_id` →
  `uxnan_turns`) so system-built pushes match the in-app ones and route to the
  high-importance channel. The Dart default icon also no longer points at
  `@mipmap/ic_launcher` (which the plugin cannot resolve as a drawable).
- Source vector + a regenerator live in
  [`tool/notification_icon/`](tool/notification_icon/README.md).

## [0.0.13-alpha.20260722+20260723] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- The no-devices state now lives inside the standard Devices screen instead of
  replacing it with a bare scaffold, so the Devices app bar and its pairing,
  profile, and settings actions remain available. The generic hub icon was
  replaced with the bundled Uxnan mobile logo.
- New threads now keep the bridge-provided title and, while it remains a
  placeholder, derive a concise title from the first user prompt and sync it
  through `thread/rename`. Explicit manual titles and later renames are never
  replaced by this automatic naming path.
- The in-conversation responding cue now shimmers its waiting label before the
  first response token. Once text starts streaming, the label disappears and
  the expressive loader behaves as a trailing cursor immediately after the
  latest streamed token.

## [0.0.12-alpha.20260721+20260722] - 2026-07-21

### Security — restored installations cannot clone a trusted phone identity

- Android Auto Backup and device-to-device transfer now exclude both secure
  storage preference files; iOS Keychain entries use a `this device only`
  accessibility class. Restoring onto another device therefore cannot silently
  copy the Ed25519 key and notification secret; an installation without its
  original secret generates a fresh identity and pairs again. The app now keeps
  its metrics controller alive from startup, so every successful (re)connection
  immediately fetches and caches the bridge's complete global activity ledger,
  even before Profile is opened.

## [0.0.11-alpha.20260721+20260721] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed — manual pairing failed over Tailscale
- The manual-pairing HTTP client used a 5s `connectTimeout`. Over Tailscale the
  first request to a peer must bring the tunnel up (DERP relay, then an attempted
  direct upgrade), which routinely takes longer — so the request was abandoned
  before it ever reached the bridge, and pairing "always failed on Tailscale but
  worked on the same Wi-Fi" even with the `100.x` address typed correctly.
  `connectTimeout` is now 20s (read/write stay at 10s: once connected the bridge
  answers immediately).

### Fixed — a version-mismatched bridge said "invalid QR/code" instead of "update the bridge"
- Pairing against a bridge older than `SECURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` 2 correctly
  fails at the handshake, but both pairing screens funnelled every handshake
  exception into a generic message — the QR screen showed *"this is not a valid
  Uxnan pairing code"* and the manual screen *"the bridge could not complete
  pairing"*. Both blame the code, so the user regenerates it forever while the
  real problem (an out-of-date bridge) is never mentioned. Reported from a real
  device after the 0.0.10 release.
- `TransportErrorKind.incompatibleVersion` is now a distinct kind (not
  `handshake`), so both screens can recognise it by type rather than by string,
  and show: *"The bridge on this PC is a different version than the app. Update
  the bridge on your PC (npm install -g uxnan-bridge) and the app, then pair
  again."*

## [0.0.10-alpha.20260720+20260720] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Simplified device-card connection feedback: connecting devices show a single
  `Detecting…` status, while the LAN/Tailscale/direct/relay badge appears only
  after a live connection is established. The Connect button retains its
  existing `Connecting…` busy state and behavior.

### Added — network-path badge (LAN / Tailscale / Direct / Relay) on the connected PC
- The devices screen now labels **how** a live connection actually reaches the
  PC, not just whether it's "connected": a small animated pill next to the
  status dot reads **LAN**, **Tailscale**, **Direct** or **Relay**, with a
  **"Detecting…"** status while a connect attempt is in flight and the path
  isn't known yet; the network badge itself appears only after connection. A
  new pure `NetworkKind` classifier
  (`domain/enums/network_kind.dart`) buckets the live channel's actual
  endpoint by IP range — `100.64.0.0/10` → Tailscale; `10.0.0.0/8`,
  `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `169.254.0.0/16` → LAN; any other
  reachable address → Direct; a host match against the paired device's
  `relayUrl` → Relay — and is exposed through a new `networkKindProvider`
  derived from the session coordinator's real `connectedDevice` +
  `connectedEndpoint` streams. This **replaces** the previous Relay/Direct
  text, which read the *global* `bridge/status.relayConnected` flag: that
  field can't distinguish LAN from Tailscale and isn't guaranteed to be scoped
  to the endpoint actually in use, so the label could misreport during a
  reconnect. The new `TransportBadge` widget (`presentation/widgets/`)
  cross-fades between states with `AnimatedSwitcher` (respecting reduced
  motion) and follows the same type-specific icon + color-pill pattern as the
  existing `CommitRefChip`. No wire/contract change — the classification is
  entirely client-side from data the bridge already advertises (`hosts`,
  `relayUrl`).

### Security — the pairing code is sent to exactly one host, the one you chose
- Manual pairing resolves the code with a single `GET /pair/resolve?code=`
  against the host the user named — typed, or picked in the "Browse nearby
  bridges" sheet (which fills the host field). It is deliberately **never**
  fanned out across mDNS-discovered candidates. The code is a shared secret
  read off the PC screen, and a successful resolve both hands out the pairing
  payload and **arms the bridge's `qr_bootstrap` window** (see the `bridge`
  CHANGELOG), so disclosing it to an unauthenticated, spoofable mDNS record
  would let any device on the same network harvest it — or answer first and be
  trusted as "your PC" with no confirmation. Covered by tests asserting that a
  second reachable bridge is never dialed, and that an empty host is rejected
  before any request leaves the device.
- Discovery is hardened as defense in depth: the mDNS TXT `addr` hint is only
  honored when it is a literal IP in private / CGNAT / loopback space
  (`isLocalAddressLiteral`), never a hostname and never a public address; the
  SRV-resolved address wins otherwise. A discovered bridge is still only ever
  contacted after the user explicitly picks it.
- The network-failure copy now guides the user: try the PC's Tailscale `100.x`
  address, or its LAN IP if on the same Wi-Fi, and notes the connection can
  fall back to the relay once paired.
- Deferred: resolving a pairing code with **no direct network path to the PC
  at all** (e.g. the phone on cellular data, the PC not yet joined to
  Tailscale) still isn't possible — it would need fetching the payload
  through the relay instead of a direct GET, which needs new relay+bridge
  contract work. See `FOR-DEV.md`.

### Security — E2EE envelope `sessionId`/`seq`/direction now authenticated as AES-GCM AAD
- Closes a gap where replay protection relied entirely on the unauthenticated
  `seq` field: a malicious relay or on-path attacker could bump a captured
  envelope's `seq` to re-trigger a non-idempotent handler (e.g. a prior
  `turn/send`/approval), wedge the channel with an out-of-range `seq`, or
  reflect a bridge→phone envelope back as if it were inbound phone traffic
  (the same session key is used both directions with no prior direction
  binding).
- `lib/infrastructure/crypto/envelope_crypto.dart`'s `EnvelopeCrypto.encrypt`/
  `decrypt` now accept an optional `aad` (passed straight through to the
  `cryptography` package's `AesGcm`). `lib/infrastructure/transport/secure_transport_layer.dart`
  adds `buildEnvelopeAad(sessionId, seq, direction)` — `sessionId` UTF-8, `seq`
  as a big-endian 64-bit integer, `0x00` separators, and a direction byte
  (`0x01` phone→bridge, `0x02` bridge→phone) — and binds it on every
  `SecureChannel.encrypt`/`decrypt`, so tampering `seq` or reflecting a message
  from the other direction now fails the GCM tag instead of silently passing
  the old unauthenticated `seq <= _lastInboundSeq` check.
- The `SecureEnvelope` wire shape, the 12-byte random nonce, and the HKDF
  session-key derivation are all unchanged. Ships together with the matching
  `bridge` change (see its CHANGELOG) — envelopes are not wire-compatible
  across the version gap.
- **The handshake now enforces `secureProtocolVersion` (bumped to `2`).** The app
  and the bridge already exchanged `protocolVersion` but neither checked it, so
  the change above would have failed as a **silent hang**: the handshake is
  untouched, so pairing/reconnect completes and the app shows "connected", after
  which every inbound frame fails its tag and is dropped in
  `session_coordinator.dart`, the RPC correlator never resolves, and each action
  just times out with nothing to diagnose. `SecureTransportLayer` now rejects a
  `serverHello` whose version differs, with a `TransportErrorKind.handshake`
  error naming both versions and telling the user to update. `ClientHello`/
  `ServerHello` take their default from `ProtocolConstants` instead of a
  hard-coded `1`, and the AAD direction bytes are sourced from
  `ProtocolConstants` too (mirroring `shared/src/constants.ts`, the source of
  truth for this cross-language contract).
- **Update the bridge and the app together.** An app on this version cannot talk
  to an older bridge and vice versa; the mismatch is now reported clearly at
  connect time instead of looking like a broken session.

## [0.0.9-alpha.20260719+20260719] - 2026-07-19

### Added — Antigravity agent (Google's `agy`) rendering
- The app now renders the bridge's new `antigravity-cli` agent as a first-class,
  branded choice — Google's Antigravity CLI, the successor to the deprecated
  Gemini CLI (its models are the Gemini family). Added `AgentId.antigravity`
  (wire id `antigravity-cli`) with its logo, "Antigravity" label and brand colour,
  so it shows in the new-conversation picker with the same treatment as every
  other agent instead of falling back to the generic "custom" look. Onboarding
  copy and the welcome logos now feature Antigravity in place of Gemini. Pairs
  with the bridge-side adapter that actually drives `agy` (see `bridge/CHANGELOG`).

### Changed — Gemini CLI hidden from the new-conversation agent picker
- Google deprecated the standalone Gemini CLI in favour of the Antigravity CLI
  (`agy`), so `gemini-cli` is now hidden from the "available agents" list on the
  new-conversation screen. The removal is a purely client-side curtain: a single
  documented `_hiddenAgentIds` set (alongside the existing `echo` dev-agent hide)
  filters the bridge-advertised `agent/list` before it is rendered. All Gemini
  wiring — the `AgentId.geminiCli` enum value and `gemini-cli` wire id, its logo,
  label and brand colour — is left fully intact, so bringing it back is a
  one-line change (delete the `'gemini-cli'` entry). Existing Gemini threads and
  the historical agent-activity / metrics breakdown are deliberately untouched.

### Fixed — a session closed and reopened mid-turn recovers the FULL agent reply
- **The reopen race that silently dropped everything produced while the app was
  closed is fixed at the root.** On reopen, the first post-reconnect deltas
  re-created the live buffer for the in-flight turn (with only the new tail),
  and the re-sync's seed guard (`turnId != activeTurnId`) then saw a match and
  **skipped seeding** — so the user saw their prompt but none of the output the
  agent had produced while the app was away, and `_finishTurn` later persisted
  that truncation for good. `_resyncThread` now **re-seeds unconditionally**
  from the bridge's accumulated `turn/list` record (which persists every
  delta/block BEFORE notifying, so the snapshot is a superset of anything the
  phone already applied — replacing never loses data). Applies to every agent:
  the recovery path is agent-agnostic (`thread_manager.dart`).
- **A turn's finalized bubble now always carries the bridge's authoritative
  final text.** `_finishTurn` previously preferred the live buffer whenever it
  held ANY text — a tail-only buffer became the permanent message. It now keeps
  the live interleave when the buffer matches (or is a prefix of) the final
  text, and otherwise falls back to the authoritative text with the live blocks.
- **Every completed turn reconciles against the bridge record** (best-effort
  `turn/read` after `turn/completed`): the persisted message is rewritten to the
  bridge's exact ordered `segments` whenever the live view diverged (a delta in
  transit during a re-sync, a re-attach that missed early blocks), so the stored
  conversation always converges to the bridge's truth.
- **Re-sync now also runs on every (re)established connection** (new
  `connectionPhases` wiring): the bridge's catch-up replay is a bounded window
  (500 frames / 10 MiB), so a long disconnection mid-turn — a network blip with
  the screen on, a cold start whose first re-sync timed out — is only
  recoverable through a `turn/list` re-pull.
- **A replayed `stream/turn/started` no longer wipes the live buffer** for a
  turn already being tracked (the reconnect replay could re-deliver it right
  after the seed).

### Fixed — activity cards no longer split a sentence mid-word
- **Blocks flagged `beforeText` by the bridge** (a parallel/background activity
  — e.g. a Claude Code subagent's tool — that landed while the main answer was
  still streaming) are now inserted BEFORE the open text run in the live buffer,
  so the run keeps extending in place and the Work-log card sits above the
  paragraph instead of cutting it mid-word. Sequential blocks keep today's
  arrival-order append (`ContentBlockEvent.beforeText`,
  `incoming_message_processor.dart`, `_LiveTurn.addBlock`).
- Tests: +8 → **669** (reopen-race re-seed, replayed turn/started guard,
  beforeText placement ×2, authoritative finalize ×2, turn/read reconcile,
  processor flag parsing).

### Added — smooth thread-delete animation
- Deleting a conversation now animates the tile out instead of making it vanish
  abruptly. On confirm, the card dims and floats the app's shape-morphing
  `PolygonLoader` over it, then fades and collapses its height (≈320 ms, Material
  3 Expressive easing) so the rows below slide up smoothly. The database delete
  is committed only **after** the card has animated away, so the list mutates
  while the slot is already invisible (no jarring pop). Honours the platform
  "reduce motion" setting — the row is dropped without the animation. Applies to
  both the active and archived thread lists.

### Changed — crypto libraries bumped to latest; native-backend activation documented
- Bumped the crypto dependencies to their latest published versions:
  `cryptography` `^2.7.0` → `^2.9.0` and `cryptography_flutter` `^2.3.0` →
  `^2.3.4`. Dependency resolution is unchanged (both already resolved to the
  latest), so `pubspec.lock` is untouched — the bump only advances the declared
  floor to match.
- Documented that the E2EE envelope crypto already runs on the platform-native
  backend on device — no `main()` activation call is required. Since
  `cryptography_flutter` **2.2.0** the plugin registers its accelerated
  `FlutterCryptography` as `Cryptography.instance` **automatically** (via its
  `dartPluginClass`) during `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`, so
  AES-256-GCM + HKDF for every envelope use the OS-native primitives rather than
  the pure-Dart fallback.
- `FlutterCryptography.enable()` is deprecated (a no-op made redundant by the
  auto-registration) and is intentionally **not** called — adding it would only
  trip `deprecated_member_use`. Non-native targets (e.g. the Dart VM under
  `flutter test`) use the byte-identical pure-Dart backend, and the AES-GCM wire
  format (12-byte nonce + 16-byte GCM tag) is unchanged, so the native backend
  interoperates byte-for-byte with the bridge.

### Fixed — deleting a thread now removes its dependent rows
- Deleting a single thread (tile long-press / conversation menu) previously
  removed only the thread row and left every dependent row behind forever. The
  `messages`, `turns`, `composer_drafts` and `git_action_log` tables all key off
  `threadId` with no database cascade, so those orphans were never re-synced or
  garbage-collected — the local SQLite DB grew unbounded with dead data and the
  message / git-action counts were inflated by rows with no thread. `deleteThread`
  now clears all four child tables and the thread in a single transaction, so a
  delete leaves nothing behind (mirrors the device-wide `deleteThreadsByDeviceId`
  path).
- Extended `deleteThreadsByDeviceId` (the "remove device" path) to also clear
  `composer_drafts` and `git_action_log`; it previously wiped only `messages` and
  `turns`, leaking the same two tables when a whole PC was unpaired.

## [0.0.8-alpha.20260716] - 2026-07-16

### Changed — one loading language across the whole app
- Every remaining `CircularProgressIndicator` is now the shared **`PolygonLoader`**
  (the M3 Expressive shape morph), so loading looks the same everywhere instead of
  splitting between the expressive loader on the redesigned screens and Material's
  default spinner on the rest: **29 call sites across 16 files**, including the
  conversation timeline, its "Agent responding…" cue, Git, the threads list and
  tiles, new conversation, the profile stats/heatmap/usage, pairing discovery,
  licenses, updates and theme import.
- Each site keeps its own weight rather than a blanket size: 48 dp for full-screen
  states, 32 dp for section blocks, 22–28 dp in sheets, 10–20 dp inline. Sites that
  had a colored spinner keep their color.
- **Two gauges intentionally stay `CircularProgressIndicator`:** the conversation's
  context-usage ring and Settings ▸ Updates' download progress. Both draw a real
  value (`percent`, `fraction`) and `PolygonLoader` is indeterminate by design, so
  converting them would have thrown that number away. `loader_consistency_test.dart`
  now enforces the rule in both directions — no stray spinner elsewhere, and those
  two still reporting a `value:`.

### Changed — Composer palettes share a clear auxiliary hierarchy
- Gave the `/` command and `@` workspace palettes the same M3 container,
  8 dp separation from the prompt pill and explicit trigger header. They read
  as sibling extensions above the composer without appearing fused into it.
- Command rows now provide a minimum 56 dp target, contained 40 dp neutral icon
  surfaces and clearer name/description hierarchy. Appearance follows the
  composer's reduced-motion setting. Filtering, workspace navigation, agent
  commands, prompt templates and insertion behavior are unchanged.

### Changed — Git history and commit details use a cleaner review hierarchy
- Preserved commit history as a flat list so its functional branch graph stays
  continuous and readable; commits were not converted into cards. Rows now use
  quiet separators and a responsive 840 dp reading bound on wider screens.
- Kept Search and Graph as the two direct app-bar actions. Branch/ref selection
  and density now live in the same vertical `IconSurfaceMenu` treatment as the
  main Git screen, reducing toolbar noise without removing either control.
- Commit details now use a 760 dp editorial column, an open message body and
  flat expandable file rows instead of one outlined card per changed file.
  Expanded diffs retain tonal containment. Git data, graph layout, pagination,
  search, branch selection and file expansion behavior are unchanged.

### Changed — Onboarding and manual pairing share the Neural Expressive language
- Removed the onboarding's persistent square-grid and fade wallpaper in favor
  of the same calm semantic `surface` used across Profile, conversations and
  Settings. Floating agent logos remain open on that canvas, while the hero
  uses the app's established rounded-rectangle geometry.
- Grouped page progress and navigation into a floating rounded surface, widened
  the responsive content bound, and made floating-agent motion respect the
  platform's reduced-motion preference.
- Constrained manual-code pairing on wide screens and aligned its rounded hero
  with the onboarding and semantic primary-container treatment. Pairing,
  discovery, validation and navigation behavior are unchanged.

### Changed — Shared loader uses the real Material 3 Expressive morph
- Replaced `PolygonLoader`'s vertex-by-index painter with the Material 3
  `LoadingIndicator` geometry used by AndroidX and the Bunpod reference: seven
  normalized rounded shapes, feature-aware cubic morph matching, rotation and
  the canonical scale pulse. The shared wrapper preserves every existing
  `size` / semantic-color call site, so workspace, model, Git, pairing and
  conversation loaders adopt the corrected animation together.
- The wrapper keeps exact requested dimensions through a fitted canonical
  48 dp canvas, isolates repaints, supports an accessibility label and freezes
  the decorative ticker on its first expressive shape under reduced motion.
  Added widget coverage for sizing, color, semantics and reduced motion.

### Changed — Workspace files follow the Neural Expressive mobile hierarchy
- The workspace browser keeps its low-noise flat tree while enforcing 48 dp
  touch targets and constraining the tree on tablet widths. Its rigid status
  strip is now a rounded tonal workspace surface with a clearer path, branch,
  ahead/behind hierarchy and the existing copy action.
- File loading now uses the shared reduced-motion-aware polygon loader. Markdown,
  source, editor and empty/error content are width-constrained on larger screens;
  binary/error states use the same calm card language as Profile and New
  conversation, while image preview remains a full-surface fit-to-screen canvas.
  File operations, Git state, search, editing and navigation are unchanged.
### Added — refresh your profile stats on demand, and pick how they keep current
- The profile's stats now carry a **manual refresh button** (mirroring the
  provider-usage header: a spinner replaces it while the fetch is in flight, and
  the stats below stay put). It is always available, whatever the mode.
- A persisted **refresh mode** in Settings ▸ *Metrics & provider usage* ▸
  *Profile stats*: **automatic** (re-fetch every time the profile is opened —
  the new default), a **5 / 15 / 30 / 60-minute poll**, or **manual only**.
  Every mode still re-fetches when a PC connects.
- **Why:** the snapshot was only re-fetched when the *connection* changed, so on
  a live connection the stats were frozen at connect time — the only way to move
  them was to kill and reopen the app. Opening the profile now refreshes them.

### Changed — the Usage settings section is now "Metrics & provider usage"
- It covers two separate things, so it now says so and names both: **Profile
  stats** (the new refresh mode) and **Provider usage**, the latter explained as
  what it actually is — each AI provider's remaining limits: how much quota is
  left, when it resets, the plan and any credit.

### Fixed — a failed backup export says what actually went wrong
- A rejected `metrics/export` now shows the **bridge's own reason** verbatim
  ("Couldn't create the backup: …") instead of the blanket "Make sure a PC is
  connected", which pointed at the connection no matter the cause — including
  when the connection was fine. `exportBackup` throws `MetricsExportException`
  carrying the reason rather than swallowing it into a null.
- A file that seals fine but can't be saved/shared now has its own message
  instead of borrowing the export-failure one.
- Pairs with the bridge fix for the actual failure this surfaced: exporting with
  **no passphrase** was rejected with `-32602 params must be an object` (see
  `bridge/CHANGELOG.md`). Exporting *with* a passphrase always worked.

## [0.0.7-alpha.20260716] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed — A started Play update could never be finished, and then read as "up to date"
- Accepting an Android update and failing to install it left the app **stuck for
  good**: it kept reporting "you're up to date" while a fully downloaded APK sat
  on the device, and neither *Check now* nor a relaunch could surface the install
  again — the only way out was updating manually from Play.
- Root cause: the app only ever trusted Play's **live** install-state stream and
  an availability of `updateAvailable`. But Play stops reporting `updateAvailable`
  the moment *we* start the flexible flow — from then on it reports
  `developerTriggeredUpdateInProgress`, while the APK downloads and while it
  waits, downloaded, for an install, **across app restarts**. That was read as
  "no update", so every check after the first one hid the very banner that offers
  the install. The download also outlives the app that starts it, so the live
  stream — the app's only other source of truth — could simply miss the moment it
  finished. Play's own contract gives this away: `installStatus` is *"defined only
  if `updateAvailability` returns `DEVELOPER_TRIGGERED_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS`"*.
- `AppUpdateService` now reads an update **already in progress** as available and
  surfaces the stage Play itself reports (`AppUpdateInfo.installStatus`) on the
  new `AppUpdateStatus.installStage` — the field the app was discarding.
- `AppUpdateController` derives its phase from that stage, so a check **resumes**
  the flow where it actually is: an update left downloaded comes back as
  *Install now* (banner + Settings → Updates) instead of collapsing to
  "available" — which would restart Play's flow — or "up to date". An install
  that never restarted the app is no longer a dead end: a re-check returns it to
  an installable state rather than a permanent spinner.
- A pending update now **bypasses the check interval** on every foreground, per
  Play's guidance that a downloaded update be surfaced whenever the user brings
  the app forward — otherwise its data silently occupies their storage. The
  interval still governs looking for a *new* version. A self-clearing
  `updateStarted` flag (`UpdatePreferencesStore`) carries this across restarts.
- Regression tests in `app_update_service_test.dart` +
  `update_controller_test.dart` (six of them fail against the previous logic):
  in-progress availability, stage surfacing, resuming a downloaded/downloading
  update, recovering a stalled install, the interval bypass and the flag's
  self-clearing.

## [0.0.6-alpha.20260716] - 2026-07-16

### Changed — Profile provider-usage cards follow the Neural Expressive hierarchy
- Provider usage cards now form a cohesive dynamic-corner group, use 44 dp
  neutral logo surfaces, responsive plan/status pills and clearer M3 typography.
  Quota percentages retain their meaningful progress bars with a more legible
  8 dp track and accessibility semantics; credit is separated into a quiet tonal
  row. Data loading, refresh and provider behavior are unchanged.

### Fixed — Activity heatmap opens on the current week (recent squares were off-screen)
- Even with correct day keys, the contribution heatmap still looked empty for the
  **in-progress year**: the grid rendered all of Jan–Dec and, scrolled to its most
  recent edge (`reverse: true`), opened on the **empty future months** — so the
  recent activity sat off-screen to the left and no painted square was ever in
  view (the caption's "N actions · M active days" was right the whole time). The
  in-progress year now **stops at today**, so the grid opens on the current week
  with the latest activity visible; past years still render in full. Regression
  test in `activity_heatmap_test.dart`.

### Added — Profile "Tokens" lens + redesigned per-agent cards
- The unified activity block gains an **Activity / Tokens** toggle. **Tokens**
  colors the heatmap by **tokens processed per day** (from the bridge's per-day,
  per-agent breakdown), re-ranks the agents by tokens and captions in tokens,
  with a note that **some CLIs don't report their full token usage, so the
  figures can be imprecise**. **Activity** is the everyday conversations +
  messages view. The token-reporting caveat remains visible in both lenses so
  the limitation is clear before interpreting any per-agent total.
- The lens selector now reuses the app's Neural Expressive **Connected Button
  Group** instead of a standalone segmented button, matching Personalization.
  The agent history is presented as one dynamic-corner card group, while the
  profile header, year control, stat grid and tablet width constraint follow the
  same semantic-surface and responsive hierarchy as the rest of the app.
- Each agent card is redesigned to read clearly: an Icon-Surface logo + name, a
  set of three **labeled** stats — the value (e.g. "174K") over a caption naming
  it ("Tokens") — instead of one cramped "9 conv · 16 msg · 174K tokens" line.
  The ambiguous single progress bar is removed: the active lens now uses quiet
  tonal stat surfaces (conversations + messages for Activity, tokens for Tokens),
  avoiding false comparisons between unlike units. Follows the M3 / Neural
  Expressive card hierarchy.

### Changed — Unified "Activity" section (one block, linked selection)
- "Conversations by agent" and the separate token widget merge into a single
  **agent-activity** block: the year selector, the contribution heatmap and the
  per-agent cards, linked by the heatmap selection (no cell = all-time; tap a day
  to scope the cards to it). Lists the **available** agents (`agent/list`) plus any
  with history. New `MetricsSnapshot.byAgentDay` (per-day, per-agent conversations
  / messages / **tokens**) supersedes the coarser `tokensByDay`; `agentBreakdown`,
  `aggregateTokensByDay` and `totalTokensOf` derive from it, and a **Total tokens**
  stat tile joins the grid. Tests: `aggregateTokensByDay` bucketing + agent
  breakdown.

### Fixed — Activity heatmap now paints (timezone-stable day keys)
- The contribution heatmap showed nothing painted (while the stat tiles had data)
  whenever the phone's timezone differed from the PC's — e.g. a UTC emulator
  against a UTC-6 bridge. The day buckets were keyed by an absolute
  local-midnight instant that reconstructed to the wrong calendar day on the
  phone, so no cell matched. Day keys are now **UTC midnight of the calendar
  date** end-to-end (bridge snapshot, drift fallback, `aggregateActivity` and the
  heatmap cells), so cells match in any timezone.

### Added — Profile "Backup" section (encrypted export / import)
- The profile now has a **Backup** card: a note that stats live on this phone +
  the PC and **can be lost without a backup**, plus **Export** and **Import**
  actions. Export seals the metrics into a tamper-proof `.uxmetrics` file via the
  bridge (`metrics/export`) and opens the native share sheet; Import picks a file
  and restores it (`metrics/import`) — a foreign/edited file is rejected, and a
  passphrase-protected file prompts for the phrase and retries. Both actions need
  a connected PC (the bridge seals/verifies), so they disable with a hint while
  offline. Full EN/ES strings.
- The passphrase dialog owns its `TextEditingController` in a `StatefulWidget`
  (disposed in `dispose()`), so the dialog's close animation never touches a
  disposed controller. Regression test in `profile_screen_test.dart`.

### Changed — Profile metrics now come from the bridge (survive an uninstall)
- The profile / per-PC metrics (conversations, messages, agents/models used,
  connection time, sessions, git actions, activity heatmap) are now sourced from
  the **bridge** (`metrics/get`) instead of the phone's local drift aggregation,
  so they **survive an app uninstall** — after a reinstall + re-pair the bridge
  re-supplies the real numbers. Provider usage/credits are unchanged (still
  live-read via `agent/usageStats`).
- New `MetricsController` (`metricsSnapshotsProvider`) fetches each connected PC's
  `MetricsSnapshot` on every (re)connection and persists it per PC in a display
  cache (`MetricsCacheStore`, SharedPreferences). `profileMetricsProvider` /
  `pcMetricsProvider` / `activityHeatmapProvider` derive from the cache (summing
  across PCs), falling back to the local `DriftMetricsRepository` only when the
  cache is empty (offline / pre-metrics bridge) so nothing regresses.
- The controller also drives the **tamper-proof backup**: `exportBackup()`
  (`metrics/export`) and `importBackup()` (`metrics/import`, throwing
  `MetricsImportException` with the bridge's reason on rejection). The profile
  "local data can be lost" note + the export/import UI land next.
- New Dart contract mirror `MetricsSnapshot` (+ `MetricsAgentUsage`,
  `MetricsActivityDay`, `aggregateSnapshots`, `aggregateActivity`). Tests: model
  parse/round-trip/mapping/aggregation + cache store round-trip/persistence.

### Changed — Message rail jump glides in/out and lands precisely
- Picking a message on the scroll rail now **eases in and out** (a soft start
  and stop, quicker through the middle, the duration scaled to the distance)
  instead of a flat, abrupt jump, and adds a short final **settle** so it lands
  precisely on the user's bubble even as content above finishes laying out.

### Changed — Message scroll rail hides at the bottom, slides in on scroll-up
- The conversation's message scroll rail is now **hidden while the timeline is
  at the bottom** and **slides in from the right edge** (with a fade) when the
  user scrolls up — driven by the same signal that reveals *Jump to latest* and
  hides the composer ribbon, so the scroll-up chrome moves as one. It is
  non-interactive while hidden and honors reduced-motion (a new `visible` prop
  on the widget, an easeOutCubic slide ~280 ms in / ~200 ms out).

### Changed — Conversation chrome clears the reading area while scrolled up
- When **Jump to latest** appears, the turn-context strip (reasoning, approval,
  edits, context and tokens) now slides down toward the composer, fades and
  collapses out of layout. The autonomous-mode notice used by agents such as pi
  follows the same transition. Both are clipped while leaving so they never
  remain visible beneath the composer's translucent veil; the jump shortcut
  naturally settles directly above the remaining composer chrome.
- The shared conversation/history scroll shortcut is now a more reachable
  **52 dp neutral circular surface** with a subtle outline, replacing the
  smaller and more saturated 44 dp `secondaryContainer` treatment in both
  **Jump to latest** and git-history **Back to top**.

### Fixed — Reasoning menu stays anchored without dismissing the keyboard
- Opening the reasoning-effort menu no longer steals focus from the composer or
  hides the software keyboard. Its popup position is recalculated when layout
  changes, so it remains attached to the reasoning control if the keyboard
  geometry changes while the menu is open.

### Changed — Turn controls start collapsed
- The turn-controls shelf above the composer (reasoning effort / approval) now
  opens **collapsed to its chevron** by default, for a quieter conversation
  surface; tapping the chevron expands the controls (the choice is per-visit).

### Fixed — Composer shelf buttons use a circular press ripple
- The reasoning / approval / collapse buttons on the composer's turn-controls
  shelf now render a **circular** tap ripple and the same M3E press-scale as the
  app-bar `IconSurface` actions (a circle-shaped `Material` + an `InkWell` with a
  `CircleBorder`), instead of a grey **square**. The reasoning control also opens
  its value menu via `showMenu` rather than a `PopupMenuButton`, whose internal
  `InkWell` was rectangular.

### Added — Message scroll rail (conversation minimap)
- Conversations gain a **message scroll rail** on the right edge — one short,
  faint tick per user message. A slight drag (or hover) reveals it: the nearest
  tick grows with a dock-style **fisheye** falloff, a preview bubble shows that
  message (its text + the turn's final reply), and releasing jumps the timeline
  to it; it auto-hides shortly after. Built as a **self-contained,
  dependency-free reusable widget** (`lib/presentation/widgets/message_scroll_rail.dart`,
  Flutter-only) so it can be lifted into another app, fed by a memoized
  `railAnchorsProvider` derived off the timeline. Shown only with ≥2 user
  messages; honors reduced-motion and 48 dp touch targets.

### Changed — Floating scroll shortcuts are bottom-centered
- The conversation's **Jump to latest** button and the git-history **Back to
  top** FAB now float **bottom-centered** (were bottom-right), clear of the
  composer's left turn-controls and right token/context indicators and reading as
  a consistent pair (one scrolls down, one up). `NeScaffold` gains a
  `floatingActionButtonLocation`.

### Fixed — Jump to latest always returns to the newest content
- Tapping **Jump to latest** now always scrolls the conversation to the bottom,
  even mid-fling or right after using the message rail. The auto-follow policy's
  `resume()` was leaving an in-progress drag/momentum flag set, so `shouldFollow`
  could stay false and the scheduled jump was skipped — the button appeared to do
  nothing. `resume()` now clears that intent, so an explicit jump-to-latest is
  never swallowed by an in-flight scroll.

### Changed — Usage & credit: persistent, manual by default, clearer labels
- The "Usage & credit" data now **persists in memory**, so scrolling the profile
  no longer reloads it; the section is always present while connected
  (loading → cards) with a **manual refresh** button. **Auto-refresh is off
  (manual only) by default**, configurable in **Settings → Usage**
  (5 / 10 / 20 min, 1 h, or manual), which also gains a **24-hour / 12-hour**
  clock toggle for reset times.
- Reset times now read **"Resets in 6h 30min"** for sub-day windows and
  **"Resets in 5d at 14:30"** for weekly/monthly windows (the clock honors the
  24/12-hour setting).
- Clearer metric labels: the connection-count tile is now **Connections** (was
  "Sessions"), the per-agent breakdown labels each figure, and the conversations
  tile is shortened to **Chats** so it no longer clips. (The per-agent breakdown
  is later folded into the unified agent-activity section above.)

### Added — Usage & credit on the profile (`agent/usageStats`)
- The Profile screen now has a **"Usage & credit"** section (shown only when a PC
  is connected) that calls the bridge's new `agent/usageStats` and renders, per
  activated provider (**Codex, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Grok**), its quota windows
  (a labelled bar with % used + reset time), plan and credit balance — read live
  from the paired PC. Not-installed providers are hidden; `authRequired` / `error`
  states show a small pill + the bridge's hint. Degrades to nothing against an
  older bridge without the handler. New `ProviderUsage` model + `usageStatsProvider`.

### Added — Profile in Settings + per-PC statistics
- The **Profile** now has a header at the top of **Settings** (avatar + name +
  active-session count) that opens it, and each PC's card overflow menu gains a
  **Statistics** entry opening a **per-PC details screen** — the same activity
  heatmap, stat tiles and per-agent breakdown, scoped to that one PC, with a
  header showing its pairing / last-seen and live connection status. The stat
  grid and per-agent breakdown are now shared widgets reused by both screens.

### Added — Profile screen: activity heatmap, stats & customization
- A new **Profile** screen (a person icon in the Devices app bar) aggregates
  activity across every paired PC — all derived locally, no bridge call: an
  identity header, headline stat tiles (time connected, longest session, agents
  used, conversations, messages, sessions, git actions, most-used transport,
  models), a **GitHub-style contribution heatmap** (one cell per day, a full
  year, with a year selector to browse past years and a metric selector —
  Combined / Conversations / Messages / Work — captioning exactly what's shown;
  tapping a day shows its count, tapping elsewhere on the heatmap clears it), and
  a per-agent breakdown (one card per agent: logo, a proportional bar and its
  labelled conversation count).
- **Profile customization:** a display name and an avatar — a picked gallery
  image (downscaled to 256 px and stored inline) or one of 12 preset icons —
  edited from a bottom sheet (tap the header or the pencil) and persisted
  on-device. Defaults to a neutral name + person glyph until set.
- Metrics come from a new local `MetricsRepository` aggregating the
  already-persisted threads / messages / git actions plus the connection-session
  log; the heatmap and totals recompute on open (`autoDispose`). No wire contract
  — everything is phone-local.

### Added — connection-session log (metrics foundation)
- New phone-local drift table (schema **v6**) recording each phone→PC connection
  session: device, transport (relay/direct), the real endpoint, start,
  last-active (advanced by the heartbeat) and end. The `SessionCoordinator` opens
  a row on connect, closes it on every teardown, and — at startup — closes any
  session left dangling by a force-kill at its last-known-alive time, so
  durations never inflate. This powers the upcoming connection metrics (time
  connected, longest session, sessions count, relay-vs-direct split) on the
  profile / per-PC screens. Phone-only — nothing crosses the wire.

### Changed — truthful, privacy-blurred PC address on the devices card
- The address under each PC name now reflects the endpoint the live channel is
  **actually** served through (the direct LAN/Tailscale host that won the dial
  race, or the relay) instead of the first advertised host. The bridge sorts its
  advertised hosts lexicographically, so a Tailscale `100.x` address always
  sorted ahead of a LAN `192.168.x` one and was shown even while connected over
  LAN — a display-only bug (the connection itself already picked the reachable
  host). The connected endpoint is now carried from the transport through the
  session coordinator (`connectedEndpointStream`) to the card. When not
  connected, it still falls back to the relay host, then the first advertised
  host.
- The address is now **blurred by default and revealed on tap** (tap again to
  re-hide), so a PC's network topology (its LAN/Tailscale IP) isn't exposed at a
  glance to shoulder-surfing, screenshots, or screen-sharing. The blur animates
  (reduced-motion aware), carries an eye affordance, and is accessibility
  labelled ("Show address" / "Hide address"). Its own tap handling never opens
  the PC's threads.

### Changed — focused composer and compact turn context
- The Neural Expressive composer now contracts slightly while idle, then
  stretches, gains vertical breathing room and subtle elevation when focused,
  without adding an outline. Voice dictation remains independently
  available beside the contextual Send/Stop action, including after text has
  already been entered; sending safely stops an active dictation session.
- The Git commit composer now shares the same focus response: 24 dp idle and
  16 dp focused side margins, 4→8 dp vertical padding, elevation 0→2, and the
  same reduced-motion-aware 220 ms transition. Its existing commit-details
  morph and separate action buttons remain unchanged.
- Reasoning/run-option knobs and approval mode moved out of the "+" menu into
  a compact icon-only shelf above the composer. The shelf is visible by
  default, folds to one chevron, and left-aligns its controls as one tight
  group. Interactive targets remain 48 dp while their neutral 38 dp visual
  surfaces and 24 dp glyphs match the context, token, and edit indicators
  anchored on the right. Approval is green for Approve for me, orange for Request
  approval, and red for Full access.
- The "+" now opens a small anchored two-row menu for Photo library and Camera
  instead of a modal sheet. The live assistant turn once again owns its
  activity cue, now a small circular progress indicator followed by the quiet
  italic "Agent responding…" label instead of the previous polygon loader.

### Changed — calmer, controllable conversation timeline
- Streaming auto-follow now yields immediately to a manual timeline drag. The
  conversation keeps following naturally when untouched, remains detached
  while the user reads older content, and resumes only after returning near the
  bottom, tapping the existing jump-to-latest affordance, or sending with
  "Scroll to latest on send" enabled. Post-layout corrections are coalesced and
  re-check user intent so a delayed callback cannot pull against a gesture.
- Thinking, work-log, and changed-files disclosures now use quiet borderless
  `surfaceContainerLow` panels that morph from compact pills into rounded
  expanded surfaces. Their Material ink response is clipped to the same
  animated shape, so taps never paint a square ripple beyond the rounded
  corners. Thinking and work-log panels start collapsed; the compact work log
  retains its count and latest one-line activity summary, and opening one
  process panel collapses the previously open panel in that assistant turn.
- Long user-message text now starts as a responsive ten-line preview with a
  subtle tonal fade and explicit Show more / Show less actions. Expansion does
  not hide image attachments, short messages keep their previous behavior, and
  Copy message always copies the complete source rather than the visible
  preview.

### Changed — Neural Expressive new-conversation full-screen dialog
- Restored direct agent comparison cards in the full-screen creation flow,
  replacing the sparse agent combobox and its extra picker sheet. Agent cards
  now form a dynamic-corner Neural Expressive group, expose sign-in state in
  place, and use semantic tonal selection rather than heavy outlines. Cards
  stay compact until selected: choosing an agent expands only its capability
  chips and automatically collapses the previously selected card.
- Moved the variable-length dialog headline into the content area, leaving the
  compact top bar for close/start actions per Material 3 full-screen-dialog
  guidance. The workspace card now has one unified tap target, section labels
  use normal title casing, the optional worktree follows the essential
  agent/model choices, and wide layouts use the shared content-width token.

### Fixed — complete default Material 3 color scheme
- The fresh-install Uxnan brand theme now derives a complete Material 3
  `ColorScheme` from the official blue, green, and error seed colors instead
  of manually supplying only a subset of roles. Every surface layer
  (`surfaceContainerLowest` through `surfaceContainerHighest`), fixed role,
  inverse role, and outline now has a deliberate tonal value, restoring visible
  depth for cards, sheets, inputs, and Neural Expressive neutral surfaces in
  both light and dark mode. Custom themes remain untouched.

### Changed — selectable text and full-surface image previews
- Removed the file-wide copy action from the viewer app bar. Markdown preview,
  syntax-highlighted source and git diff text now support native selection and
  contextual copying; the inline editor retains the platform `TextField`
  selection/copy controls.
- Image previews now occupy the complete viewer surface. They start with the
  whole image visible (`BoxFit.contain`) and pinch zoom/pan use the full screen
  instead of the former horizontally padded preview rectangle.

### Added — repo-wide search in the workspace file browser
- The workspace file browser now exposes the same full-screen Material search
  pattern used by threads and Git history, backed by the existing
  `workspace/searchFiles` fuzzy search. Results emphasize the filename and
  show its workspace-relative path beneath it.
- Opening a search result lazily expands only that file's ancestor folders in
  the underlying tree and positions its row near the middle of the viewport
  while search still covers the tree. The viewer then opens, so returning
  reveals the file immediately without exposing a scroll animation. Root-level
  files near the end naturally clamp to the maximum scroll extent. Dismissing
  search without choosing a result leaves the tree unchanged.

### Changed — the autonomous-mode banner is dismissible + a settings toggle
- The autonomous ("YOLO") mode banner (shown for agents like pi) now has a
  **close button** that dismisses it for the current visit; it reappears the
  next time the conversation is opened (per-visit `State`, not persisted).
- New **Settings ▸ Conversation ▸ Pi Agent** sub-section with an
  Autonomous-mode banner toggle to hide the banner **permanently** vs. see it
  each time (the default, now with the close button). Persisted via
  `ConversationPreferencesStore` + `showAutonomousBannerProvider`.

### Added — agent slash commands in the composer `/` palette
- The composer's `/` palette now lists the **agent's own special ("slash")
  commands** the bridge advertises via the new `agent/commands` method (e.g.
  Claude Code's `/compact`, an ACP agent's advertised commands, or a project's
  custom `.gemini/commands` / `.opencode/command` / `~/.codex/prompts`
  templates), above the existing client-side entries (file hand-off + prompt
  templates). New `AgentCommand` entity + `agentCommandsProvider` +
  `ThreadManager.loadCommands`.
- Picking a command inserts `/<name> ` so arguments can be added; on send a
  `/name args` that matches an advertised command is routed as a real command
  (`turn/send` `command`) — the bridge resolves and runs it — while any other
  text is sent verbatim as before. `AgentCapabilities` gains a `commands` flag.
- Generic renderer: the palette shows whatever the bridge advertises, so new
  agent commands appear with no app change; commands the agent can't run
  headless (`headlessSupported: false`) are hidden.

## [0.0.5-alpha.20260711] - 2026-07-11

### Added — Grok agent support
- **Grok** (xAI's coding CLI) is now a selectable agent. New `AgentId.grok` (wire
  id `grok`) in `agent_id.dart`, with its logo, `'Grok'` label and accent color
  wired in `AgentVisuals` (`grok.svg` asset + `UxnanColors.grokAgent`). The agent
  picker, conversation header and capability-gated controls pick it up
  automatically from the bridge's `agent/list` (name, availability, capabilities)
  and `agent/models` (models, context window, reasoning-effort knob).
- No block-rendering change was needed: Grok's tools stream as the same canonical
  content blocks as every other agent (plan → PlanCard, diffs → DiffBlock, shell →
  CommandCard, approvals → the interactive approval card), because the renderer is
  purely block-`type`-driven and the bridge normalizes each agent's own tool names
  to those shared blocks.

### Fixed — failed agent turns now show the error in the conversation
- A turn that ends in `stream/turn/error` (e.g. a quota / "usage balance
  exhausted" error) now surfaces the bridge's error message as an inline red
  error banner at the end of the turn, instead of the "responding…" cue silently
  vanishing with no explanation. Three fixes along the path:
  - **`IncomingMessageProcessor`** now reads the reason from the contract's
    **nested `error.message`** (`TurnErrorParams: error: { code, message }`); it
    was reading a non-existent top-level `message`, so `TurnErrorEvent.message`
    was always `null`. A flat `message` is still tolerated for back-compat.
  - **`ThreadManager._finishTurn`** carries the message through and appends a
    `SystemContent(kind: error)` block to the failed assistant message (keeping any
    thinking/text/work-log that streamed before the failure).
  - **`_SystemBanner`** renders an empty error as a localized fallback
    (`turnFailed`, EN/ES). Reuses the existing red error-banner widget — no new UI
    component. Works both live and on re-sync: the bridge now persists the failure
    reason as a `system`/`error` content block in history, so reopening a thread
    (or a bridge restart) still shows the banner.

### Added — interactive multiple-choice question card

- The agent can now ask the user structured questions mid-turn via a new
  `question` content block (`stream/content/block { type:'question', questionId,
  questions }`), rendered as an interactive card that mirrors the approval card:
  - **`QuestionContent`** (+ `QuestionRequest` / `QuestionItem` / `QuestionOption`
    value objects) in `message_content.dart`, tolerant of both nested
    (`{request:{…}}`) and flat payloads; added to the `MessageContent.fromJson`
    dispatch and the `MessageContentView` renderer switch.
  - **`_QuestionCard`** renders each question's header badge + text, then its
    options as selectable rows — radio-style (single) or checkbox-style
    (`multiple`) — with each option's optional description as a subtitle. A
    primary **Submit** (disabled until every question with options has a
    selection) sends the chosen labels; a secondary **Skip** sends empty
    answers. Once answered the card morphs (`AnimatedSize`) into a settled state
    showing the chosen labels + a relative time, with an inline spinner while
    sending and re-enable on failure. Read-only when the thread / question id is
    missing.
  - **`respondQuestion`** on `ThreadManager` sends `turn/send { questionResponse:
    { questionId, answers } }` where `answers` is one label-list per question.
  - **`questionResponsesProvider`** tracks per-`questionId` phase (idle / sending
    / resolved / failed) and persists answers on-device via **`QuestionResponseStore`**
    (key `uxnan.question.responses`) so an answered card stays resolved across
    scrolls and app restarts.
  - EN/ES strings added (`questionNeedsAnswer`, `questionAnswered`,
    `questionAnsweredAt`, `questionHeaderFallback`, `questionSubmit`,
    `questionSkip`, `questionSkipped`, `questionFailed`).

### Added — autonomous-mode announcement for agents that run without per-action approval
- New `autonomous` capability on `AgentCapabilities` (shared contract) and
  `AgentDescriptor` (mobile entity), surfaced in the UI so the user knows up front
  that an agent acts and edits without asking first:
  - **New-conversation screen:** an "Autonomous mode" chip (`Icons.auto_awesome_outlined`) shown for agents whose capability `autonomous` is `true`.
  - **Conversation screen:** a banner above the thread (`_AutonomousBanner`)
    explaining the agent runs autonomously. EN/ES strings added
    (`newThreadCapAutonomous`, `conversationAutonomousMode`).
- Pi is the first agent to use this: `pi-adapter.ts` now advertises
  `autonomous: true` (it runs headless in YOLO mode with no pre-tool approval
  channel by design). OpenCode/Claude/Codex/Gemini keep `autonomous` unset
  (false) — they expose real per-action approvals.

### Fixed — wide tables in conversation messages now scroll horizontally instead of squeezing

- **Root cause:** `_TextBlock` in `message_content_view.dart` used `MarkdownStyleSheet.fromTheme()` defaults, which set `tableColumnWidth` to `FlexColumnWidth` — columns squeezed to fit the viewport, wrapping every cell into a tall stack.
- **Fix:** replaced the bare `fromTheme().copyWith()` with a full `MarkdownStyleSheet` using `IntrinsicColumnWidth()`, which sizes columns to their content. Wide tables now trigger `flutter_markdown_plus`' built-in horizontal scroll with a visible scrollbar.
- **Refactor:** extracted the shared `uxnanMarkdownStyleSheet(context)` to `lib/presentation/theme/markdown.dart` so both the conversation `_TextBlock` and the file viewer `_MarkdownBody` use a single source of truth for markdown styling (headings, anchors, code blocks, blockquotes, tables, horizontal rules).

## [0.0.4-alpha.20260703] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed — model / agent / project lists now re-sync when the bridge changes
- **Root cause:** `agentModelsProvider` (and `agentsProvider`,
  `projectsProvider`) were plain fetch-once `FutureProvider`s that cached the
  bridge's reply in memory for the whole app session and never re-fetched — so a
  model **added on the bridge** (e.g. a new Claude version like Sonnet 5) never
  reached the picker until a cold app restart, even after updating the bridge.
- **Fix (`application_providers.dart`):** these three providers now
  `ref.watch(connectedDeviceProvider)`, mirroring the already-correct
  `bridgeStatusProvider`, so they re-run `agent/models` / `agent/list` /
  `project/list` on every (re)connect — updating the bridge and reconnecting is
  now enough for new models/agents/projects to appear.

### Added — bridge-update banner + model picker refresh
- The bridge now reports whether it's outdated on `bridge/status`
  (`updateAvailable` / `latestVersion`, from its own npm check). A new,
  **dismissible** (swipe-away or close-icon) informational banner atop the
  thread list nudges the user to update the bridge **on their PC** when it's
  behind — the phone can't update it, so there's no action button. The
  **phone never queries npm** — it only renders what the bridge reports
  (`bridgeUpdateProvider`, `_BridgeUpdateBanner`, `BridgeStatus` entity extended
  with `latestVersion`/`updateAvailable`). EN/ES strings added. A fixed "bridge
  version / update" row in Settings → About is deferred to avoid colliding with
  the in-flight settings overhaul (see `FOR-DEV.md`).
- **Manual refresh in the model picker** (`model_picker_sheet.dart`): a refresh
  icon in the sheet header re-syncs the list on demand
  (`ref.invalidate(agentModelsProvider)`), so a model added on the PC shows
  without even reconnecting.
### Changed — settings grouped (General / Workspace / System) + About logo + licenses fix
- **The settings landing groups its sections** under **General** (Personalization,
  Notifications), **Workspace** (Conversation, Source control) and **System**
  (Updates, About). **Models** moved into the Conversation section as a **Claude**
  sub-group; each section screen is now organised into labelled sub-groups
  (Conversation → *Agents* / *Claude* / *Conversation*; Notifications, Source
  control and Updates each get a header). The standalone Open-source licenses tile
  was removed from the landing — it lives inside About, where it belongs.
- **About shows the app logo** (theme-tinted `logo_fg.svg` via `flutter_svg`)
  instead of a placeholder glyph.
- **Fixed — open-source licenses showing empty.** `packageLicensesProvider` now
  tolerates a failing license collector (logs + keeps going) so the bundled
  licenses still load, and the screen distinguishes a real load error (with a
  retry) from a genuinely empty registry. New widget test
  (`licenses_screen_test.dart`) covers the screen rendering registered packages.

### Changed — in-app updates: single package, flexible download + in-app install, configurable interval
- **Swapped `flutter_upgrade_version` → `in_app_update_flutter`** (one package for
  both platforms). Android now uses the Play **flexible** flow: background
  download with a **real progress %** (`InstallStateAndroid` byte counts) and an
  **in-app install** (`completeUpdateAndroid`) — no more full-screen immediate
  flow. iOS looks up the App Store version via a `dio` iTunes query and presents
  the store page in-app with StoreKit `SKStoreProductViewController`
  (`showUpdateForIos`), deriving the numeric App Store id from the lookup — the
  external `url_launcher` open is now only a fallback.
- **Settings → Updates is a full section screen**: the **installed version**, a
  live state card (checking / available / **downloading with %** / **downloaded →
  Install now** / installing / error), and the download → install flow **in the
  section** — you no longer have to go to Threads to install. The Threads
  *Update available* banner stays, driven by the same controller (in sync).
- **Configurable check interval** — every launch / 6h / 12h / 24h (default) / 48h
  / weekly / monthly, persisted; replaces the hardcoded 12h auto-check throttle
  (`UpdateCheckInterval`, `UpdatePreferencesStore.readInterval/writeInterval`).
- New `AppInstallStage`/`AppInstallProgress`, extended `AppUpdatePhase`
  (downloading/downloaded/installing) and `AppUpdateController`
  (`download`/`install`/`setInterval`). EN/ES strings added; tests for the
  service (Android/iOS/unsupported), controller (phases + interval throttle) and
  the interval store round-trip updated. Spec: `architecture/00-index.md`,
  `FOR-DEV.md`, `FOR-HUMAN.md`.

### Changed — settings is now a sectioned landing, not one long scroll
- **`SettingsScreen` is a landing of section entries.** Instead of listing every
  option at once, the first screen shows a compact list of sections
  (`NeNavTile`s in dynamic-corner groups); tapping one opens a dedicated screen
  with just that section's options (`Navigator.push`, the existing `static push`
  pattern). New screens under `lib/presentation/screens/settings/sections/`:
  `NotificationsSectionScreen`, `ConversationSectionScreen` (now owns the
  context-indicator selector), `ModelsSectionScreen`,
  `SourceControlSectionScreen`, `UpdatesSectionScreen`. Appearance still opens
  `PersonalizationScreen`.

### Added — About screen + open-source licenses
- **`AboutSectionScreen`** — app identity + installed version (new
  `appPackageInfoProvider` backed by the new `package_info_plus` dependency), a
  short description, a source-code link (GitHub), and an entry to the licenses.
- **Open-source licenses** — `LicensesScreen` lists every third-party package
  (aggregated from Flutter's `LicenseRegistry` via `packageLicensesProvider`,
  value object `PackageLicenses`) and `LicenseDetailScreen` shows each package's
  full license text.
- New EN/ES strings for the section subtitles, About and licenses screens.
- Tests: `settings_screen_test.dart` reworked for the landing + per-section
  navigation; new `licenses_provider_test.dart` (aggregation + `PackageLicenses`).
  Spec: `architecture/02c` §14 (settings landing por secciones).

## [0.0.3-alpha.20260702] - 2026-07-02

### Added — theme import from a file / URL, in a full-screen editor
- **Theme import is now a full-screen editor** (`ThemeImportScreen`,
  `theme_sheets.dart`), not a cramped bottom sheet (which overflowed on a big
  paste): it mirrors the app's NE form pattern (à la `ManualCodeScreen`) — a
  transparent `NeTopBar` with a Close, a paste field that **fills the screen and
  scrolls internally**, the alternative sources on one row, and a bottom
  full-width **Import** CTA (disabled until there's text).
- **Three import sources**, all filling the same field so the user reviews
  before importing: **paste**, **a `.json` file** from the device (new
  `file_picker` dependency), and **an http(s) URL** (`dio`, plain response,
  connect/receive timeouts + a 5 MB guard). Inline errors for a bad URL / read
  failure.
- **Fixed — imported/exported themes no longer masquerade as built-ins.** A
  theme exported from a seeded example carried a `uxnan.builtin.*` id; re-imported
  (even renamed) it was flagged built-in — undeletable and **not persisted**
  (built-ins are seeded, not stored, so it vanished on restart). Now **export**
  emits a fresh non-builtin id for built-in themes, and **import** reassigns a
  fresh id to any theme whose id is a built-in id (in addition to the existing
  collision reassignment) — imports are always normal, deletable, persisted
  custom themes.
- 3 widget tests (`theme_sheets_test.dart`); the import tests in
  `theme_manager_screen_test.dart` updated for the full-screen editor. Spec:
  `architecture/02c` §3.1 (import sources).
- **Build:** `file_picker`'s transitive `flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle`
  requires compiling against Android API 36, so `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
  pins `compileSdk = 36` and `android/build.gradle.kts` bumps the plugin
  subprojects to 36 (compile-time only — `minSdk` 24 / `targetSdk` unchanged).

### Changed — shared `NeCard` primitive + calmer card tone (My Devices, Threads, New conversation)
- **New `NeCard` widget** (`ne_card.dart`): the app's discrete-card primitive —
  one calm `surfaceContainer` tone (not `surfaceContainerHighest`, which NE §2.4
  reserves for inputs/active chips) + a 16 dp radius + the M3E `spatialFast`
  press feedback (wraps `ExpressiveCard`). Centralizes the card look so it stays
  consistent app-wide and ends the `surfaceContainerHighest`-for-cards drift.
- **Migrated the hand-rolled cards** on **My Devices** (`_DeviceCard`), the
  **Threads** list (`ThreadTile`, unread tint rebased on the calmer tone), and
  the **New-conversation** dialog's folder + worktree cards to `NeCard`.
- Left as-is (correct per NE): the pairing screen (already exemplary — filled
  inputs legitimately use `surfaceContainerHighest`), the new-conversation
  agent/model selectors (intentional borders + selection tint), and the Git
  history/commit-detail screens (their `surfaceContainerHighest` is on code
  chips/pills, not content cards).

### Changed — Neural Expressive redesign of the settings area (less visual noise)
- **Settings, Personalization and Prompt Templates** rebuilt on the repo's own
  Neural Expressive components to cut visual noise (guide §4.6 / §7.2): quiet
  section labels (`onSurfaceVariant`, no accent color) instead of primary-colored
  headers; **dynamic-corner card groups** (`ExpressiveCardGroup`, 24/4 radii +
  3 dp gap) with a calm `surfaceContainer` tone instead of hand-rolled
  `surfaceContainerHighest` cards; **no per-row dividers** (the gap + corners
  separate rows); and `SegmentedButton` → **`ConnectedButtonGroup`** (the M3E
  replacement) for the context-indicator and theme-mode selectors.
- **New shared widgets** (`settings_tiles.dart`): `NeSectionHeader`,
  `NeSectionHint`, `NeSwitchTile`, `NeNavTile` — the grouped-settings building
  blocks all three screens now reuse (DRY). The language picker and template
  list also became dynamic-corner groups. Behavior/persistence unchanged; widget
  tests updated for the new controls.

### Added — Settings ▸ Models: hide Claude Code's "latest" aliases
- **New "Models" settings section** (`settings_screen.dart`) with a switch,
  *Show Claude Code "latest" models*, plus an explanatory note describing what
  the `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` "(latest)" aliases do (they always route to the
  newest version of each tier your account can use). Turning it off hides those
  moving-target aliases from the model picker so only concrete pinned versions
  show; conversations already running on an alias keep working. Persisted
  locally (`ConversationPreferencesStore.readShowClaudeLatest` /
  `writeShowClaudeLatest`, key `uxnan.models.showClaudeLatest`; defaults on) via
  `showClaudeLatestModelsProvider`.
- **`AgentModel.isLatestAlias`** (`agent_model.dart`) parses the new
  `@uxnan/shared` contract flag, so the picker identifies aliases from the
  bridge instead of hardcoding ids; the currently-selected model stays visible
  even when aliases are hidden. New entity + widget tests; the picker filter is
  display-only (thread run-option/context-window lookups are untouched).

## [0.0.2-alpha.20260628] - 2026-06-28

### Added — inline `@` file mentions and a `/` command palette in the composer
- **The message composer now surfaces two inline affordances above the pill
  while typing**, the way most agent GUIs do:
  - **`@` file/folder mentions** — typing `@` opens a suggestion panel. With an
    empty fragment (`@`, `@lib/`) it **browses** that directory (one level, via
    `workspace/list`); once you type a fragment it switches to a **repo-wide
    fuzzy search** (the new `workspace/searchFiles`, honoring `.gitignore`) that
    shows full relative paths ranked best-first. Picking a folder drills in,
    picking a file finalizes the reference as `@path` + a space. The path simply
    becomes prompt text, which already reaches the agent CLI verbatim. Disabled
    (with a "no folder" note) when the thread has no `cwd`. **Graceful fallback:**
    if the connected bridge predates `workspace/searchFiles` (-32601), `@name`
    degrades to browsing + filtering the current folder, so the picker still
    works against an older bridge.
  - **Completed `@` mentions render as inline code-style badges** — a
    `MentionTextController` paints each `@path` token monospace with a subtle
    primary tint (like a markdown code span). Purely visual: the underlying text
    is unchanged, so the sent prompt stays plain.
  - **`/` command palette** — when the message *starts* with `/`, a panel lists
    uxnan's own client-side commands (these are **not** the agent CLI's
    interactive slash commands): a built-in *files* entry that hands off to the
    `@` picker, plus the user's **prompt templates**. A `/` mid-message (e.g. a
    path) never opens it.

### Added — manage `/` prompt templates in Settings
- **Settings → Prompt templates** — a new screen to **create, edit, delete and
  reset** the `/` palette's prompt templates. Templates are single-language
  (whatever the user types) and persist on-device (`PromptTemplatesStore`,
  SharedPreferences). On a fresh install the shipped defaults (*explain*,
  *review*, *fix*, *tests*) are **seeded in the app's language** and are then
  fully user-owned; the user may also clear them entirely (the palette then
  offers only the `@`-file hand-off). New `PromptTemplate` model +
  `promptTemplatesLibraryProvider` (mirrors the custom-themes library). New
  EN + ES strings (`settingsPromptTemplates*`, `promptTemplates*`).
- Trigger detection and text-replacement are the pure, unit-tested
  `mention_suggestion.dart` helpers (`detectComposerTrigger`, `splitFileQuery`,
  `applyFileMention`, `applyCommand`); the palette catalog + filter live in
  `composer_commands.dart` (`matchComposerCommands` + `defaultPromptTemplates`);
  the badge rendering in `mention_text_controller.dart`. New
  `FileBrowserManager.listDirectory` (one level) + `searchFiles` (repo-wide,
  `workspace/searchFiles`). New EN + ES strings (`composerMention*`,
  `composerCommands*`, `composerCmd*`). 40 new tests (31 unit + 9 widget).

### Added — search the commit history
- **The Git commit history screen now has a search affordance**, matching the
  threads list pattern: an app-bar `IconSurface` search icon opens a full-screen
  M3 `SearchAnchor` view that filters commits by message (title/body), full or
  short SHA, author (name/email) or any ref name; tapping a result opens that
  commit's detail. Search runs over the commits **currently loaded** into the list
  (the history pages in lazily as the user scrolls / via "Load older commits"),
  since `git/log` exposes no server-side search. The filter is the public,
  unit-tested `matchCommits` helper (mirrors `matchThreads`). New strings
  `gitHistorySearch` / `gitHistorySearchHint` / `gitHistorySearchEmpty` (EN + ES).

### Fixed — phantom keyboard on returning from a commit's detail
- **Returning from the commit detail screen no longer leaves a soft keyboard up
  on the history list** (which has no text field of its own). The detail screen's
  `SelectableText` fields (message, SHA, metadata) open a text-input connection
  that resurfaced on the previous route; `GitHistoryScreen` now drops focus
  (`FocusManager.instance.primaryFocus?.unfocus()`) after the detail screen pops —
  the same fix the file browser uses when returning from the file viewer.

## [0.0.1-alpha.20260628] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed — onboarding shows the correct bridge install command
- **The "Install the bridge on your PC" onboarding step now tells the user to
  install the bridge as a global npm package, not run it via `npx`.** The bridge
  is published as the global CLI `uxnan-bridge` (its `bin`), so the page now shows
  the canonical two-step flow — `npm install -g uxnan-bridge` (install once) then
  `uxnan-bridge start` — matching `bridge/docs/installation.md`. Replaced the
  single `npx uxnan-bridge` command card with two labelled `CommandCardWidget`s
  and reworded `onboardingInstallBody` accordingly (EN + ES), adding the
  `onboardingInstallStepInstall` / `onboardingInstallStepStart` strings. Updated
  `onboarding_screen_test.dart` to assert both commands.

### Changed — manual-code pairing screen redesigned for Neural Expressive
- **The "Pair with a code" screen (the no-camera pairing alternative) now follows
  the app's Material 3 + Neural Expressive language** instead of the previous
  minimal M3 form. It adopts a transparent `NeTopBar` (scroll veil) over an
  `IconSurface` back button — matching the QR scanner's chrome — an Icon Surface
  hero, the "Browse nearby bridges" mDNS action as a tappable dynamic-corner
  `ExpressiveCard` (with a hint subtitle), the host/code fields grouped on a single
  `NeSurface` with filled (borderless, focus-outlined) inputs, a pill (`StadiumBorder`)
  primary CTA, and the `PolygonLoader` shape-morph indicator while resolving the
  code (replacing the M3 `CircularProgressIndicator`). New strings
  `manualCodeFormTitle` / `manualCodeBrowseHint` (EN + ES). Pairing logic is
  unchanged.

### Changed — onboarding NE polish (single-unit scroll, agents named, unified buttons)
- **Each onboarding page now scrolls as a single unit.** `OnboardingPageLayout`
  previously kept the decorative floating-agents band fixed and only scrolled the
  middle region, so tall pages (the install page) looked like a half-scrolling
  panel. The whole page body (top band + hero + title + body + extra child) now
  lives inside one `SingleChildScrollView` (a `LayoutBuilder` + min-height
  `ConstrainedBox` keeps short pages vertically centered, tall ones fully
  scrollable). The only fixed chrome stays the top **Skip** button and the bottom
  nav buttons + page-dot indicator (in `OnboardingScreen`).
- **Page 2 (Features) names the five wired agents.** `featureMultiAgentBody` now
  reads "Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode and Pi — with more agents
  on the way." (EN + ES), replacing the partial list that omitted Pi.
- **Page 3 (Install) explains the bridge root.** Added an NE note card (`NeSurface`,
  outlined, folder glyph) below the start step: the folder where you start the
  bridge becomes its root, so one bridge serves every folder/repo under it — no
  need to start it per project. New string `onboardingInstallRootNote` (EN + ES).
- **Unified the primary buttons across onboarding + pairing.** New shared
  `NeButton` (`widgets/ne_button.dart`) — a `StadiumBorder` pill at the M3 Medium
  size (48 dp), with `NeButton.icon` and an outlined secondary variant — now drives
  the onboarding Next/Back/Scan controls, the camera-permission "Allow / Open
  settings" and scanner-error "Pair with a code" buttons, and the manual-pairing
  CTA shares the same shape/size. Replaces the mix of default-shaped 56 dp
  `FilledButton`/`OutlinedButton`s so every primary action matches.

## [0.0.1-alpha.20260627] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed — recovered conversations keep messages and activity interleaved
- **A conversation recovered after a reconnect now shows each response with its
  work log inline, in order** — instead of every command/activity log stacked
  above one big merged paragraph. When the phone re-synced a thread (`turn/list`,
  on reconnect or re-open), the agent's text and its structured blocks arrived in
  separate fields with no order, so the recovered turn collapsed all text into a
  single block with all activity on top. The bridge now sends an ordered
  `segments` interleave; the app renders from it (`thread_manager.dart`
  `_persistTurns` + `_seedLiveTurn` prefer `segments`, building contents via
  `_assistantContentsOrdered`), so the recovered turn reads exactly like a live
  one — text, the work log it triggered, more text, in sequence. Falls back to
  the previous blocks-first layout when the bridge sends no `segments` (older
  bridge, or the on-disk history fallback). Tests: +3 (`thread_manager_test.dart`:
  resync renders segments interleaved; resync without segments falls back
  blocks-first; a re-attached in-flight turn seeds its live buffer interleaved).

### Added — in-app update checker (Play In-App Updates + iOS App Store)
- **The app now checks for newer versions and lets the user decide — no silent
  install.** A throttled check runs on cold start and on resume (at most once
  every 12 h); a manual *Check now* lives in **Settings → Updates**, and an
  *Update available* banner appears atop the threads list when a newer version
  ships. On **Android** it drives the **Play In-App Update** API (an *immediate*,
  user-confirmed, Play-managed download + install + restart); on **iOS** it looks
  up the **App Store** version and opens the listing. The banner is dismissible
  per store version (it won't nag again until a *newer* one ships).
- Wraps the `flutter_upgrade_version` plugin behind a guarded, injectable
  `AppUpdateService` (`infrastructure/updates/`) that maps both platforms to a
  single `AppUpdateStatus` value object; an `AppUpdateController`
  (`presentation/providers/update_providers.dart`) owns the throttle, dismissal
  and the user-initiated launch. State + throttle persist in
  `UpdatePreferencesStore` (`uxnan.updates.lastCheckMs` /
  `…dismissedVersion`). Added `url_launcher` for the iOS App Store open action,
  and R8 keep rules for `com.google.android.play.core.**` (release minify is on).
- **Caveats:** Android In-App Updates only report a real update when the build
  was installed from **Google Play** (a Play *open-testing* / beta track build) — a
  sideloaded `--release`/debug APK reports "no update", by design. The **iOS**
  path is inert until the app has an **App Store listing** (the iTunes lookup
  returns empty before then). A separate **GitHub-Releases-APK** update channel
  is **not** covered by this plugin (tracked in `FOR-DEV.md`).
- Tests: `app_update_service_test.dart` (platform mapping, guards, start/open),
  `update_preferences_store_test.dart`, `update_controller_test.dart`
  (throttle / dismiss / launch) — 24 new tests.

### Fixed — commit history is now in correct chronological order
- The History screen's commits were sometimes out of time order (a branch's
  commits grouped together, so some commits made around the same time showed far
  apart). Fixed in the bridge — `git/log` switched from `--topo-order` to
  `--date-order` — so the phone now matches the desktop ADE and GitHub. No
  mobile code change; it consumes the bridge fix.

### Changed — history branch graph: VS Code swimlane curves
- **The History graph now uses the VS Code swimlane model + true arc
  connectors.** Lanes *compact* — when a branch merges, the extra lanes waiting
  for the commit collapse into the node and the lanes to their right shift one
  column left — so the graph narrows with flowing curves instead of leaving
  parallel gaps. Connectors are real circular arcs (`Path.arcToPoint`): a
  quarter-circle (radius ≈ one lane) into/out of a node, and a gentle S when a
  passing lane shifts column — replacing the previous stable-lane layout and
  tiny rounded-step connectors. Node dots are unchanged (solid dot, with a
  separate outer ring on merges). `git_history_screen.dart` (`_buildGraph`
  swimlane layout → per-row `_GraphEdge` list, `_GraphPainter` arc geometry).

### Changed — file browser: git-conventional colours + dimmed ignored entries
- **Untracked files use the conventional git colour again, and git-ignored
  entries are now dimmed (muted + italic).** PR #25 had coloured *untracked*
  files in a muted italic tone — but that's the universal "git ignores this"
  affordance, and it diverged from the rest of the app, where untracked is the
  `gitUntracked` blue (the Git screen, commit detail, diff views). The browser
  now matches that convention: untracked → blue, like added/modified/deleted in
  their tokens. Rows no longer carry a medium weight at all — colour alone (plus
  italic for ignored) conveys the state. The muted-italic *dimmed* treatment is
  reserved for **ignored** entries, a distinct concept (a file type vs a git
  state), surfaced by the bridge's new `WorkspaceEntry.ignored` flag and carried
  on `FileEntry` / `FileTreeNode`. Ignored is independent of `gitStatus`
  (ignored entries never appear in `git/status`), so an ignored folder dims even
  while collapsed and its children dim when expanded.
  - `domain/entities/file_browser.dart` (`FileEntry.ignored`,
    `FileTreeNode.ignored`), `application/managers/file_browser_manager.dart`
    (carries the flag through), `presentation/.../widgets/file_tree_tile.dart`
    (untracked → `gitUntracked`; ignored → muted + italic).
  - Tests: +5 (`file_tree_tile_test.dart`: untracked/modified/ignored/clean
    visuals; `file_browser_manager_test.dart`: the ignored flag flows through and
    survives a git-status repaint).

### Fixed — a mid-stream turn's earlier reply is no longer lost on reconnect (Bug A)
- **The live re-attach now seeds the streaming buffer with the in-flight turn's
  partial output.** When the app was killed and reopened while the agent was
  mid-turn, the re-attach (`activeTurnId`) recreated the `_live` buffer **empty**,
  so the text the agent had already streamed before the close (e.g. "on it, let
  me check…") vanished from the bubble — only output produced *after* the
  reconnect showed, and because new deltas made the buffer non-empty, the
  finalized message also dropped the earlier part. The bridge already persists
  deltas as they stream and returns the accumulated text/thinking/blocks for the
  active turn in `turn/list`, so `_resyncThread` now pre-fills the re-attached
  `_LiveTurn` from that partial content (blocks first, then the text run kept
  last so the next delta extends it in place). No bridge/contract change — it
  consumes the partial content `turn/list` already reports. Confirmed against the
  fresh `[reconn]` capture: a full close/reopen handshakes as `trusted_reconnect`
  with "no catch-up backlog to replay", i.e. `_live` is genuinely empty at resync
  time. Tests: +1 (`thread_manager_test.dart`: a resync seeds the live buffer
  with the in-flight turn's partial text).
  - `application/managers/thread_manager.dart` (`_resyncThread`, `_seedLiveTurn`).

### Fixed — a resume resync no longer hangs the thread view for 30 s (Bug A)
- **The resume/reconnect `turn/list` resync now uses an 8 s timeout** instead of
  the request correlator's 30 s default. When the app returns from the background
  the socket can be silently half-open, so the resync round-trip gets no reply;
  the `[reconn]` capture showed it stall the full 30 s (`turn/list resync failed
  (kept local)`) while the thread sat un-refreshed. With the tighter bound it
  gives up fast and keeps local state — and the already-shipped live re-attach
  (`activeTurnId` + the `_ensureLive` self-heal) restores any in-flight turn from
  the stream — so the view recovers quickly. Only the resync (newest-page) pull is
  bounded; user-driven older-page paging keeps the default timeout. The bound is
  injectable (`ThreadManager.resyncTimeout`) so tests don't wait it out. Tests:
  +1 (`thread_manager_test.dart`: a resync over a half-open socket fails fast,
  not after 30 s) → **433** unit + widget tests, all green.

### Fixed — dial direct hosts in parallel so a dead host can't stall reconnection (Bug A)
- **`DirectTransportSelector` now connects to every advertised direct host
  concurrently** instead of one-at-a-time, and keeps the first that connects
  within the per-host timeout (the rest are disconnected). Serial dialing made
  reconnection pay one **full** per-host timeout for every unreachable address
  ahead of a live one — the `[reconn]` capture showed a resume burning 2 s on a
  dead virtual NIC (`172.27.192.1`) **and** 2 s on a Tailscale host still waking
  from OS suspension before it could even try the next candidate. Parallel
  dialing returns as soon as *any* host answers, so a single slow/dead address no
  longer adds to the relink latency. The relay fallback (when every direct host
  fails) is unchanged. Pairs with the bridge-side fix that stops advertising
  unreachable virtual-NIC addresses in the first place (see `bridge/CHANGELOG.md`).
  Tests: +1 (`transport_selector_test.dart`: a hanging host no longer blocks a
  reachable one) → **432** unit + widget tests, all green.

### Fixed — a turn no longer "dies" on the phone after reconnecting mid-stream
- **The phone re-attaches to a turn still in flight on the bridge.** Before, the
  "responding…" indicator + composer Stop button were driven only by the
  in-memory `_live` buffer, created **only** on `turn_started`. If the app
  missed that event (reconnected mid-turn, or was killed and reopened while the
  agent kept running on the PC), every later `delta`/`thinking`/`block` was
  silently **dropped** — the turn looked ended, the app waited for nothing, and
  the only way forward was to type again. Three coupled fixes in
  `application/managers/thread_manager.dart`:
  - **Self-heal (`_ensureLive`).** A stream event for a turn we aren't tracking
    now lazily (re)creates the live buffer and re-lights the activity indicator
    instead of being dropped — any further agent output revives the view. The
    bridge serializes one in-flight turn per thread, so a delta for a different
    `turnId` correctly replaces a stale one.
  - **Proactive re-attach on resync.** `resyncActive`/`_resyncThread` reads the
    new `turn/list` → `activeTurnId` (the bridge's authoritative in-flight turn,
    absent after a bridge restart) and recreates `_live` before persisting, so
    the indicator + Stop reappear immediately on resume — without resurrecting a
    turn that already ended.
  - **Authoritative completion text.** `TurnCompletedEvent` now carries the
    bridge's full final `text` (`processors/incoming_message_processor.dart`,
    `processors/domain_event.dart`); `_finishTurn` uses it when the live buffer
    captured no streamed text (re-attached mid-turn), so the finalized bubble is
    never left empty/partial — while preserving the interleaved live text+blocks
    in the normal case.
  - Tests: `test/unit/application/thread_manager_test.dart` (+3: self-heal,
    resync re-attach, authoritative-text completion). NOTE: this is the
    "active-turn loss" half of the remote-connection work; the relink-latency /
    reconnect-loop half is still tracked in `FOR-DEV.md` (Bug A).

### Changed
- **File browser: file rows show details + are comfortable by default, with a
  compact option.** Two changes to the in-conversation file browser rows:
  - **Details line replaces the redundant name.** With extensions hidden, each
    row showed a second line that just repeated the file's path/name *with* the
    extension — noise. That line is gone; in its place, files now show a details
    line — **size · modified date** (the modified date comes from the new
    `WorkspaceEntry.mtime`, localised via `intl`) — toggleable from the 3-dot
    menu (*Show file details*, on by default). Directories never show details.
  - **Taller rows by default + a compact mode.** Rows were cramped at a single
    line's height; they're now a little taller by default so the name + details
    breathe (`UxnanSpacing.sm` vertical), with a *Compact rows* toggle in the
    3-dot menu that restores the previous tight spacing (`UxnanSpacing.xs`).
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/files/widgets/file_tree_tile.dart`,
    `file_browser_screen.dart`, `providers/file_browser_providers.dart`
    (`showFileDetailsProvider`, `compactFileRowsProvider`), `FileEntry`/
    `FileTreeNode.mtime`, new l10n `fileBrowserShowDetails` /
    `fileBrowserCompactRows`.
- **File browser: untracked files now clearly distinct from tracked ones.** In
  the in-conversation file browser, untracked files were painted in
  `onSurfaceVariant` — a muted grey barely distinguishable from the
  tracked-unchanged `onSurface` tone, so you couldn't tell at a glance which
  files git is and isn't tracking. The split is now carried by weight + style,
  not just hue: every *tracked* row (unchanged or changed) uses a medium weight,
  while *untracked* rows stay regular weight and **italic** in the muted
  `onSurfaceVariant` tone. Each git state keeps its own colour
  (tracked-unchanged neutral, untracked muted, added/modified/deleted/renamed in
  their diff colours).
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/files/widgets/file_tree_tile.dart`
    (`gitStatusColor`, `FileTreeTile`).
- **Consistent circular floating scroll buttons.** The git history's
  back-to-top button was M3's default rounded-square `FloatingActionButton`,
  while the conversation's scroll-to-bottom button is a circle; NE's action
  language is circular, so both now share one widget
  (`presentation/widgets/ne_circular_button.dart`, `secondaryContainer`).
- **Commit detail: per-file expandable diffs.** The commit detail screen no
  longer shows one big combined diff under the file list; each touched file is
  now its own collapsible card (collapsed by default) that reveals **just that
  file's diff** when tapped — mirroring the clean per-file cards of the
  version-control screen. The combined `git/commitShow` diff is split per file
  client-side (keyed by new/old path). `NeSurface` was hoisted from
  `git_screen.dart` into `presentation/widgets/ne_surface.dart` for reuse.
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/git/git_commit_detail_screen.dart`,
    `presentation/widgets/ne_surface.dart` (new), new l10n
    `gitHistoryNoTextDiff` / `gitHistoryBinaryDiff`.

### Fixed
- **File browser: folders/files no longer keep a stale git colour after a
  commit.** Once a file or its parent folder was painted as changed, the colour
  could never be cleared: `FileTreeNode.copyWith` read `gitStatus: gitStatus ??
  this.gitStatus`, so passing `null` (a node gone clean) preserved the old
  status, and `_applyGitStatus` early-returned the node unchanged whenever its
  new status was `null`. After committing through the git screen (or an external
  CLI commit on the same PC), the browser kept showing the change. `copyWith`
  now sentinel-guards `gitStatus` (passing `null` *clears* it, like `error`),
  and the repaint walk rebuilds a node whenever its status actually changed —
  including a non-null → null transition — so committed changes drop their
  colour immediately. Added a regression test covering the modified → clean
  path.
  - `domain/entities/file_browser.dart` (`copyWith`),
    `application/managers/file_browser_manager.dart` (`_applyGitStatus`),
    `test/unit/application/file_browser_manager_test.dart`.
- **Git history graph: pass-through lanes no longer draw diagonal "hooks".** A
  lane just crossing a row was routed to `outgoing.indexOf(occupant)`, which —
  when the same parent occupied two lanes (a commit with multiple children,
  common around merges) — returned the *first* lane, so the other lane bent
  sideways every row. Pass-through lanes now draw a straight vertical in their
  own column (lanes are never compacted), matching VS Code / the desktop graph.
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/git/git_history_screen.dart`
    (`_GraphPainter`).
- **Git history graph: no more ref-chip overflow, cleaner lanes.** In graph
  mode each row now shows a single width-capped primary ref chip (branch > tag
  > HEAD > remote) plus a `+N` marker instead of every chip inline, so a tip
  with several refs (e.g. `HEAD`/`main`/`origin/main`) can no longer overflow
  the row; `CommitRefChip` ellipsizes when width-capped. The graph connectors
  are now VS Code-style rounded steps (vertical → arc → vertical) instead of
  swoopy S-curves. (The missing-commits / phantom-lane problem itself is fixed
  bridge-side — `git/log` now uses topological order + offset pagination + a
  merge-safe parser; this page just consumes the corrected, opaque cursor.)
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/git/git_history_screen.dart`,
    `widgets/commit_ref_chip.dart`; regression widget test for the overflow.

### Added
- **Redesigned git history + full commit detail.** The history screen is now a
  single clean, flat list (no card chrome — matches the file browser) with two
  app-bar `IconSurface` toggles: **graph** (a VS Code-style swimlane overlay —
  fixed-height rows so dots align, branch-stable colors that follow a branch
  across columns, smooth branch/merge curves, and a distinct merge node = solid
  dot + separate outer ring) and **compact** density. Branch/tag/HEAD chips
  (from the new `GitCommit.refs`), a colored short-SHA badge + green/red `+/−`
  on each row, **infinite scroll** + a **back-to-top** FAB, and a *Load older
  commits* footer. Tapping a commit opens a new full-screen
  **`GitCommitDetailScreen`** (via `git/commitShow`): full message, ref chips,
  author/committer/date, copyable SHA, parents, stats, the **file list**
  (status + per-file `+/-` + rename `from <old>`), and the **complete unified
  diff** (colored, horizontally scrollable, truncation notice). An app-bar
  **branch/ref picker** (`git/branches`) views any branch's/remote's history
  read-only (no checkout), with a "Viewing <ref>" banner + one-tap return to
  HEAD.
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/git/git_history_screen.dart` (rewrite),
    `git_commit_detail_screen.dart` (new), `widgets/commit_ref_chip.dart` (new).
- **File browser: "Collapse all folders" action.** A new `IconSurface`
  (`unfold_less`) in the file browser app bar collapses every expanded
  directory in one tap; it only appears when at least one folder is open.
  Fetched children are kept in the tree so re-expanding is instant
  (`FileBrowserManager.collapseAll`).
  - `application/managers/file_browser_manager.dart`,
    `presentation/screens/conversation/files/file_browser_screen.dart`.
- **Much broader file-type recognition in the browser + viewer.** Syntax
  highlighting now resolves ~70 extensions and well-known extensionless files
  (`Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `.env`) instead of ~20; the
  file-tree icons gained categories (data/config, archives, spreadsheets,
  shell, fonts, audio, video, text). Unknown grammars fall back to plaintext
  safely (never throw).
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/files/file_viewer_screen.dart`
    (`_languageForPath` + `_languageByExtension`),
    `presentation/screens/conversation/files/widgets/file_tree_tile.dart`
    (`fileTypeVisuals`).
- **Dedicated Theme Manager screen (`ThemeManagerScreen`).** The custom-themes
  library moved out of the Personalization list into its own M3 Expressive +
  Neural Expressive screen: a responsive grid (`SliverGrid`, max-extent tiles)
  of **live preview cards**, each painted with the theme's own colors — a dual
  theme shows light|dark side by side, a single theme one panel — with a
  brightness chip (*Light & dark* / *Light only* / *Dark only*) and *Active* /
  *Built-in* badges. Tap a card to activate it; **long-press to enter
  multi-select** for bulk delete / export. *New* / *Import* / *Export all* /
  *Reset* live in the `NeTopBar` (`IconSurface` + overflow); the bar swaps to a
  selection bar with a live count while selecting. This fixes the
  "30 themes → scroll Personalization to the bottom for any action" problem and
  adds bulk import (already array-aware) + bulk delete/export.
  - `presentation/screens/settings/theme_manager_screen.dart` (new).
  - `presentation/screens/settings/theme_sheets.dart` (new): Import and Export
    are **bottom sheets**, not dialogs — the Neural Expressive surface for
    input + menus (pasting JSON / choosing copy-vs-file). Confirmations remain
    `AlertDialog`s. Reused by the editor.

### Changed
- **Floating composer over a scroll veil (conversation + git screens).** The
  message composer and the git commit bar no longer sit on a solid surface
  band. They now float over the timeline / file list — which scrolls *under*
  them — backed by a `NeComposerVeil`: a vertical surface gradient that is
  transparent at the top (so content shows through as it scrolls past) and
  solid at the very bottom, mirroring the top bar's veil. The scroll reserves a
  bottom spacer equal to the composer's live height (measured via a new
  `MeasureHeight` widget) so the last message/card still rests just above the
  pill, and the conversation's jump-to-latest button is lifted by the same
  amount.
  - `presentation/widgets/measure_size.dart` (new), `widgets/ne_top_bar.dart`
    (`NeComposerVeil`), `screens/conversation/conversation_screen.dart`,
    `screens/conversation/git/git_screen.dart`.
- **Stronger Neural Expressive app-bar scroll veil.** The transparent top bar's
  gradient is more present (top alpha `0.75 → 0.92`, mid `0.45 → 0.62`) so the
  back/actions read confidently against busy content, while still dissolving to
  fully transparent at the lower edge (never a solid band).
  - `presentation/widgets/ne_top_bar.dart`.
- **File browser conveys git state by name colour, not status dots.** The small
  decorative grey type-dots are gone; each row's leading glyph is now the
  file-type icon and the **name + icon colour** carries the git state —
  tracked-unchanged files read as `onSurface`, **untracked** ones as a muted
  grey (`onSurfaceVariant`, previously the untracked blue), and
  added/modified/deleted/renamed in their git colour (only an actual change
  bumps the weight). New shared `gitStatusColor` helper.
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/files/widgets/file_tree_tile.dart`.
- **Custom themes can now be single-brightness (light-only / dark-only) or
  dual.** A `CustomTheme` authors at least one side; the other, when needed for
  rendering, is derived from the authored side's key colors
  (primary/secondary/tertiary/error) via Material 3 — so blue/brown/green
  chosen for light become the tone-correct blue/brown/green for dark. JSON
  carries the cardinality: a one-sided document imports as a single theme and
  exports only that side; a two-sided document is dual. `schemaVersion` 1 → 2
  (v1 documents load as dual). See *Fixed* for the parser that feeds this.
- **A dual custom theme no longer locks the System/Light/Dark picker.**
  `effectiveThemeModeProvider` forces a *single* theme to its own brightness
  (so it can't hide behind a mismatched OS setting) but lets a *dual* theme (or
  the brand baseline) follow the user's choice; `themePickerEnabledProvider`
  re-enables the picker for dual themes. `app.dart` applies the effective mode.
- **Personalization slimmed down.** The inline library list + per-row menus +
  library-action rows are gone; the screen now shows the theme-mode picker, a
  compact custom-theme card (master switch + a *Custom themes* entry that opens
  the manager and previews the active theme), and the language selector.
- **Theme editor follows single/dual.** Light/Dark tabs show only for a dual
  theme; a single theme shows its side plus *Add a {light/dark} side* (promotes
  to dual via `withOtherSideDerived`). Import/Export/Derive-from-seed use bottom
  sheets. Saving no longer force-writes the global theme mode.
- **Theme editor app bar reworked.** *Save* (primary) and *Export* are the app
  bar actions; *Reset brightness* and *Derive from seed* moved into an overflow
  menu; the bottom Save button is gone. The *Import* action was removed from
  the editor — importing JSON belongs to the library manager, not a theme you
  already have open.
- **Preview-card overflow menu is legible on every palette.** The three-dot
  menu on a theme card sat over the theme's own (often dark) preview, so the
  app's `onSurface` glyph vanished in light mode; it now uses a fixed neutral
  grey that reads on both light and dark surfaces.
- **New themes are created dual from one seed.** The *New theme* flow dropped
  its redundant brightness toggle: pick a seed color and a full Material 3 light
  **and** dark theme is generated (the dark side derived), nudging users to
  configure both — single themes come from importing a one-sided JSON. The two
  built-in templates likewise derive their dark side (no second hardcoded
  palette; `UxnanColors` stays the only hand-tuned palette).
- **i18n:** new theme-manager / brightness-chip / multi-select / add-side keys
  (en + es), regenerated localizations.
- Tests: new `theme_manager_screen_test` + `custom_theme_editor_screen_test`,
  `custom_theme_test` single/dual group, rewritten `personalization_screen_test`
  for the slim screen. Full suite green; `flutter analyze` clean.

### Fixed
- **File browser path bar no longer rises like a composer when a keyboard
  shows.** The browser pins its body (`resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false`) so the
  read-only bottom path bar stays anchored, and it drops focus when returning
  from the file viewer so any soft keyboard left over from the viewer's inline
  editor dismisses instead of shoving the path bar upward.
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/files/file_browser_screen.dart`.
- **Markdown preview no longer stretches tables vertically.** The file viewer's
  Markdown body now uses `IntrinsicColumnWidth` (was the framework default
  `FlexColumnWidth`, which squeezed every column to fit the viewport and wrapped
  each cell into a tall stack); wide tables get `flutter_markdown_plus`'
  built-in horizontal scroll with a visible scrollbar. The style sheet was also
  filled out — `h4`–`h6`, list bullets, padded/decorated blockquotes, a real
  horizontal rule, table borders/padding, and tapped links copy their URL to
  the clipboard (no `url_launcher` dependency).
  - `presentation/screens/conversation/files/file_viewer_screen.dart`
    (`_MarkdownBody`), new l10n `fileViewerLinkCopied`.
- **Imported themes persist (incl. multi-theme JSON), and the import bar copy
  is clearer.** A late-finishing library hydrate could re-seed the built-ins
  over a freshly-imported theme on a fast first run, losing it on the next
  restart; `CustomThemesLibrary` now flags user mutations and never lets a
  stale hydrate clobber them. Importing a JSON **array of several themes** adds
  every entry — and the dedup now tracks ids across the whole batch, so even a
  JSON with repeated ids keeps each as a distinct, separately-saved theme
  (instead of overwriting). Single- and dual-scheme themes are still both
  accepted per entry.
- **Built-in themes (Midnight / Sandstone) are healed from code on load.** A
  device that persisted the built-ins under an older build kept their broken
  dark side (a light-ish copy — dark mode and the dual preview showed light on
  both sides). Built-ins are app-owned templates, so `CustomThemesLibrary`
  now reconciles every built-in entry against the current code definition on
  hydrate (user-authored themes pass through untouched) and rewrites the
  corrected library. Editing a built-in now forks it into a new user theme so
  the reconciliation never clobbers a deliberate edit.
- **Custom theme JSON import now detects light/dark and stops defaulting to
  purple.** The importer only understood Uxnan's own `{light, dark}` document;
  any other shape left both scheme maps empty, and `CustomThemeColors.fromJson`
  then materialized the Material 3 baseline palette — whose primary is the
  canonical `#6750A4` purple. That is why "the import always saved a purple
  theme" and "light/dark was never detected". The parser is now tolerant of
  the three shapes a user actually pastes:
  - **Uxnan native** — `{ "light": {...}, "dark": {...} }`.
  - **Material Theme Builder export** — `{ "schemes": { "light": {...},
    "dark": {...}, "light-medium-contrast": {...}, ... } }`. The base
    `light`/`dark` schemes are used; the contrast variants are ignored. The
    role keys already match Material's, so these import directly.
  - **A single flat scheme** — role keys at the top level. Its brightness is
    detected from an explicit `"brightness"` field or, failing that, the
    `surface` (then `onSurface`) luminance, and it is applied to the matching
    side only.
  Missing roles in a partial document now fall back to a Material 3 scheme
  **seed-derived from the document's own `primary`** for the correct
  brightness (so a partial *dark* import stays dark) instead of a fixed
  light-purple palette. A document with no recognizable scheme now throws a
  `FormatException` (surfaced as an import-failed snackbar) instead of
  silently producing purple.
  - `domain/value_objects/custom_theme.dart`: `CustomThemeColors.fromJson`
    gained a required `brightness` + seed-derived fallback; `CustomTheme.fromJson`
    routes through a new `_extractSchemeMaps` (native / Material Theme Builder
    / flat) + `_detectBrightness`, and pairs an absent side off the present
    side's primary; new `CustomTheme.parseImport` → `CustomThemeImport`
    reports which sides were found so the editor can patch just one.
  - `presentation/screens/settings/custom_theme_editor_screen.dart`: *Import*
    now uses `parseImport` — a single-brightness palette patches only its side
    (leaving the other untouched) and flips the visible tab to match; a full
    theme replaces both.
  - The library-level *Import* on the Personalization screen inherits the same
    tolerant `CustomTheme.fromJson`, so Material Theme Builder and flat
    single-scheme JSON now import there too (a single scheme is paired into a
    complete light+dark theme).
  - `test/unit/domain/value_objects/custom_theme_test.dart`: new
    "tolerant multi-format import" group (Material Theme Builder, flat
    light/dark detection, explicit `brightness`, no-purple partial fill,
    `parseImport` sides, scheme-less throws).

### Added
- **`git/log` RPC contract.** The shared package gains three new types
  (`GitCommit`, `GitLogResult`, `GitLogParams` in `models/git.ts`) plus
  the runtime registration of `git/log` in the JSON-RPC method registry
  (`method-registry.ts` and the typed `methods.ts`). This is the
  contract half of the commit history feature; the bridge handler and
  the mobile manager land in the next commits.
  - `architecture/02b-contracts-and-requirements.md` lists `git/log` in
    the git method table.
- **`git/log` bridge handler.** The bridge exposes the new RPC: it runs
  `git log --format=...%x1e -z --shortstat` and parses the stream into
  the typed `GitCommit[]`. Cursor semantics: the caller passes the last
  commit's SHA on the next page; the bridge uses `<cursor>^` to start
  from the parent so the cursor itself is excluded. A fresh repo (no
  HEAD) returns `{commits:[], hasMore:false}` instead of a 128 exit, so
  the history screen opens cleanly on a brand-new repository. 21/21
  git tests pass.
  - `bridge/src/git/git-service.ts`: new `log(cwd, {limit, cursor,
    ref})` plus a `parseLogOutput` helper (shortstat from `--shortstat`
    is emitted after each `%x1e` record and is associated with the
    previous commit via deferred attachment).
  - `bridge/src/handlers/git-handler.ts`: new `git/log` handler with
    tolerant param coercion (optional `limit: number`, `cursor?: string`,
    `ref?: string`).
  - `bridge/test/git/git-service.test.ts`: three new tests (`log`
    returns commits newest-first with author/parents/stats; cursor
    pagination + hasMore + nextCursor; empty repo returns an empty
    list).
  - `architecture/02a-system-architecture.md` §5.8.6 documents the new
    handler and its cursor pagination contract.
- **Mobile `git/log` support (`GitActionManager.log`).** The mobile
  half of the bridge RPC: the domain value objects (`GitCommit`,
  `GitLogResult`, `GitLogParams` with a tolerant JSON codec) and a
  `log(GitLogParams)` method on `GitActionManager`. Pure read — no
  side effects on the manager state, no `git/status` refresh (the
  history screen is independent of the working-tree state, the same
  way the conversation timeline is independent of `git/status`).
  12/12 git action manager tests pass.
  - `uxnanmobile/lib/domain/value_objects/git/git_log.dart`: new
    `GitCommit` (sha, shortSha, parents[], author/committer name+email+
    timestamp, messageTitle, messageBody, stats?), `GitLogResult`
    (commits, hasMore, nextCursor), `GitLogParams` (cwd, limit?,
    cursor?, ref?) with `toRpcParams()`.
  - `uxnanmobile/lib/application/managers/git_action_manager.dart`:
    new `log(GitLogParams)` method.
  - `uxnanmobile/test/unit/application/git_action_manager_test.dart`:
    two new unit tests (round-trip parse of the bridge payload +
    empty-result handling).
- **Git commit history screen (`GitHistoryScreen`).** Fourth and final
  commit of the history feature: the mobile UI on top of
  `GitActionManager.log`. Two views share the same cursor-paginated
  data, switched via a `ConnectedButtonGroup` (Neural Expressive §4.5):
  - **List** — chronological commit rows (`ExpressiveCard`, title,
    "Merge" badge when more than one parent, author + relative date,
    +/- stats).
  - **Graph** — GitKraken-style lanes assigned by parent continuation
    with Bézier curves connecting parents to children.

  Cursor-based pagination (50 commits per page), *Load older commits*
  footer, pull-to-refresh, empty + error states with a Retry button.
  Tapping a row opens a bottom sheet with the full message, authors,
  parents, stats, and **Copy SHA** / **Copy message** actions (each
  with a SnackBar confirmation). The `Icons.history_rounded`
  `IconSurface` lives in `GitScreen`'s app bar (visible only when a
  repo is open) and pushes the new screen. Built strictly on the
  Neural Expressive design system: `ExpressiveCard` for rows,
  `PolygonLoader` for the initial-load spinner, `UxnanSpacing` /
  `UxnanRadius` tokens throughout.
  - `uxnanmobile/lib/presentation/screens/conversation/git/git_history_screen.dart`:
    new screen with the `List` and `Graph` views, the lane-assignment
    algorithm (`_assignLanes`), and the custom `_GraphPainter` that
    draws lane tracks, the commit circle, outgoing lines, and Bézier
    branch curves.
  - `uxnanmobile/lib/presentation/widgets/connected_button_group.dart`:
    new shared widget implementing Neural Expressive §4.5 — a
    physically fused horizontal strip with dynamic corner radii (outer
    stadium, inner 4 dp), neighbour-squish on press via `spatialFast`.
    Asserted to 2–5 options per spec.
  - `uxnanmobile/lib/presentation/screens/conversation/git/git_screen.dart`:
    new `IconSurface` in the app-bar `actions` row that pushes
    `GitHistoryScreen`.
  - `uxnanmobile/l10n/app_en.arb` + `app_es.arb`: 19 new keys
    (history title, button, list/graph view labels, empty/loading/error
    states, merge badge, details sheet, copy actions with snackbars).
  - `test/widget/presentation/git_history_screen_test.dart`: 5 new
    widget tests (list rendering, empty state, error state, list↔graph
    toggle, details bottom sheet).
    `test/widget/presentation/connected_button_group_test.dart`: 4 new
    widget tests (renders N values, onChanged fires, selected uses
    bold text, asserts 2–5 options).
    `test/widget/presentation/git_screen_test.dart`: 1 new test
    verifying the History `IconSurface` is exposed in the app bar.
    394/394 mobile tests pass; 339/339 bridge tests pass.
  - `architecture/02a-system-architecture.md` §5.8.6 documents the UI
    half of the history feature (lane algorithm, list+graph views,
    bottom sheet actions, pull-to-refresh, NE design tokens).
  - `uxnanmobile/FOR-DEV.md` flips the entry to **DONE**.

### Changed
- **File browser, Git screen and file viewer: app-bar refresh moved to
  pull-to-refresh.** The standalone *Refresh* `IconSurface` is gone from the
  `FileBrowserScreen`, `GitScreen` and `FileViewerScreen` app bars; users now
  refresh by pulling down on the list / file tree / file content (a
  `RefreshIndicator` wrapping the scroll surface — same gesture the threads
  list already uses, same `BouncingScrollPhysics` +
  `AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics` combo). The
  `GitScreen` keeps its existing *Pull* (badged, behind > 0) action;
  refresh was redundant with it. The `FileBrowserScreen` keeps its
  *Show extensions* / *Show hidden* toggles — moved into a new
  three-dot overflow menu (see *Added* below) so the bar stays under
  the M3 ≤3-actions guideline and the chrome matches every other
  Neural Expressive screen (the conversation screen uses the same
  `IconSurfaceMenu` pattern for its overflow). The screens no longer
  carry refresh chrome that the threads list and conversation screen
  never had; the whole app now refreshes by
  pull-to-refresh except for the few actions that need to be one-tap
  reachable (pull, expand-all, the conversation menu).
  - `file_browser_screen.dart`: new `_refresh()` wraps
    `manager.loadRoot(cwd)`; `CustomScrollView` wrapped in
    `RefreshIndicator(onRefresh: _refresh, …)`. Refresh
    `IconSurface` removed from the app bar; toggle `IconSurface`s
    moved to a new `IconSurfaceMenu<void>` (see *Added*).
  - `git_screen.dart`: new `_pullToRefresh()` wrapper for the
    existing `_refresh(cwd)` (which takes a parameter — the
    `RefreshIndicator` needs a parameterless `Future<void>
    Function()`); `CustomScrollView` wrapped in
    `RefreshIndicator(onRefresh: _pullToRefresh, …)`. Refresh
    `IconSurface` removed from the app bar.
  - `git_screen_test.dart`: new widget test (`GitScreen no longer
    renders a Refresh button in the app bar`) locks in the change
    (the `Icons.refresh_rounded` glyph is absent and the
    `RefreshIndicator` is in the tree).
  - `file_viewer_screen.dart`: refresh `IconSurface` removed from the
    app bar; the scrollable bodies (code, markdown source/preview, diff)
    are each wrapped in `RefreshIndicator(onRefresh: _load, edgeOffset:
    …)` so the spinner clears the transparent `NeTopBar`. `_CodeBody`
    and `FileDiffViewer` gain the `AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics` combo
    so the pull works even when the content fits the viewport.

### Added
- **File browser: three-dot overflow menu.** The two view toggles
  (*Show file extensions* / *Show hidden files*) that used to live as
  standalone `IconSurface`s in the app bar are now in a popup menu
  triggered by a `Icons.more_vert_rounded` `IconSurfaceMenu` — the same
  pattern the conversation screen, the git screen overflow and the
  threads list use for their low-frequency actions. The bar now
  carries a single trailing action (the overflow) so it lines up with
  the M3 ≤3-actions guideline and the rest of the Neural Expressive
  chrome. Each toggle is a `CheckedPopupMenuItem<void>` with the same
  icon and label the `IconSurface` used, so the selection state is
  visible at a glance when the menu is open.
  - `file_browser_screen.dart`: the app bar's `actions:` now holds a
    single `IconSurfaceMenu<void>` with two
    `CheckedPopupMenuItem<void>` entries (one per toggle). The
    `showFileExtensionsProvider` / `showHiddenFilesProvider` setters
    are unchanged — the menu is a pure UI surface, the persistence +
    the on-device store are the source of truth.

### Added
- **Threads screen — scope selector (Agent / Project).** The threads filter
  bar now starts with a small chip-styled **scope selector** on the left
  that shows the active scope (Agent or Project) and opens a popup to
  switch between them. To its right, the chip bar shows the matching
  filter: *All + each agent* under the Agent scope, *All + each project*
  (one per distinct `projectId` / `cwd`) under the Project scope. Only
  one scope is visible at a time — the previous "two stacked chip bars"
  layout is gone. Switching scope clears the other dimension's filter so
  the two stay independent (an agent filter has no meaning under the
  Project scope and vice versa). The project filter — which was already
  fully implemented (`_projectsPresent` / `_projectKeyOf` / bridge
  `loadThreads(projectId:)`) but hidden behind the `_projectFilterEnabled`
  flag — is now reachable from the UI without any back-end change. Same
  visual language as the filter chips (M3 `ChoiceChip` + popup menu
  trigger), same horizontal `ListView` scrolling, so the whole bar reads
  as one coherent surface. New l10n keys: `threadsFilterByAgent`,
  `threadsFilterByProject`, `threadsFilterScopeTooltip` (en + es).
  Covered by three widget tests in `threads_list_test.dart` (default
  scope renders Agent, switching to Project swaps the chip bar,
  switching scope clears the other dimension's filter).
- **Git screen commit composer autofocus on open.** The title field of the
  commit composer in the full-screen `GitScreen` now opens with primary
  focus, so the keyboard pops up as soon as the repo state loads (matches
  the conversation composer: the user opened the screen to type a commit
  message). The existing tap-outside-to-unfocus behavior on the timeline
  area (`GestureDetector` + `FocusScope.unfocus` in `GitScreen.build`) is
  preserved — tapping the file list or branch summary still dismisses the
  keyboard. Implemented as `autofocus: true` on the title
  `_BorderlessField` (only the title; the description and co-author fields
  stay non-autofocus so expanding the details doesn't yank the caret).
  `_BorderlessField` gained an optional `autofocus` parameter (default
  `false`) so the other call sites are unaffected. Covered by two widget
  tests in `git_screen_test.dart` (`GitScreen autofocuses the commit
  title field on first build` + `GitScreen keeps the
  tap-outside-to-unfocus behavior on the commit title field`).

- **Composer autofocus on conversation open.** The message composer's text
  field now opens with primary focus, so the keyboard pops up the moment a
  conversation is opened (matches the user's expectation: the composer is
  the primary input surface, and opening a thread almost always means
  "type something"). The existing tap-outside-to-unfocus behavior on the
  timeline (`GestureDetector` + `FocusScope.unfocus` in
  `ConversationScreen`) is preserved — tapping the message area still
  dismisses the keyboard. Implemented as a single `autofocus: true` flag on
  the composer's `TextField` (no `FocusNode` plumbing required) so the
  change is intentionally minimal; the field's lifecycle is fully owned by
  the framework. Covered by two widget tests in
  `conversation_widgets_test.dart` (`ComposerBar autofocuses the text field
  on first build` + `ComposerBar keeps the tap-outside-to-unfocus
  behavior`) that lock in both the autofocus and the unfocus-from-tap.

### Added — `[reconn]` diagnostic logs for Bug A (relink latency after resume)
- Temporary, greppable `[reconn]` timing logs at the resume/reconnect sites
  (`SessionCoordinator.resume` / `verifyConnection` / `_runReconnectLoop` /
  `_dropAndReconnect` / `_heartbeatTick` and `DirectTransportSelector.select`)
  to pin where the post-"recents" relink spends its time before changing the
  reconnect logic. No behavior change; logs are suppressed unless built with
  `--dart-define=ENABLE_LOGGING=true`. Tracked (with capture steps + recovery
  session IDs) in `uxnanmobile/FOR-DEV.md` → "Bug A". To be removed once the
  root cause is fixed.

### Fixed — QR scanner (and FCM push) broken in `--release` by R8 stripping
- **Root cause:** AGP 9 enables R8/minification by default for `release`, and
  in full mode it stripped the no-arg constructors of the reflectively-
  instantiated component registrars used by ML Kit (`BarcodeRegistrar`) and
  Firebase (`FirebaseMessagingKtxRegistrar`) — `NoSuchMethodException:
  <init>[]`. That left the barcode scanner null, so `mobile_scanner` threw
  `genericError: … getClass() on a null object reference` on camera start
  (dark screen), and it would also have broken background push in release.
  Debug builds (no minify) were unaffected, which is why it only showed under
  `flutter run --release`. **Fix:** added `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` with
  keep rules for the ML Kit, Firebase and mobile_scanner classes (and any
  `ComponentRegistrar`), keeping minification **on** (`isMinifyEnabled = true` +
  `isShrinkResources = true`) so the release stays small while the scanner and
  push keep working.
- **Graceful fallback instead of a dead screen:** the scanner had no
  `errorBuilder`, so a start failure left the user on a dark screen with the
  package's cryptic default glyph and no way out. A camera start error is now
  hoisted into stable top-level state (`_ScannerError`) — out of the package's
  rapidly-rebuilding `errorBuilder`, which made the fallback buttons
  unresponsive — showing the real error (code + message) plus **Pair with a
  code** (manual pairing) and **Try again** (recreates the controller).
  (`qr_scanner_screen.dart`; new l10n keys `qrCameraErrorTitle`,
  `qrCameraErrorBody`, `actionRetry`.)
- **Modernized `mobile_scanner` 5.2.3 → 6.0.11** along the way (newer CameraX
  1.5 + ML Kit 17.3; source-compatible: autoStart, `onDetect`, 3-arg
  `errorBuilder`). Requires `compileSdk 36` (already our default) and bumps the
  **iOS deployment target to 15.5** (`project.pbxproj`).

### Changed — bundle id renamed `com.uxnan.mobile` → `dev.luisgamas.uxnanmobile`
- **Android.** `android/app/build.gradle.kts` `namespace` + `applicationId`
  rewritten. The Kotlin source moved from
  `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/uxnan/mobile/MainActivity.kt` (package
  `com.uxnan.mobile`) to
  `android/app/src/main/kotlin/dev/luisgamas/uxnanmobile/MainActivity.kt`
  (package `dev.luisgamas.uxnanmobile`). `AndroidManifest.xml` was unaffected
  (it uses `${applicationName}` / `.MainActivity`, no hard-coded `package=`).
- **iOS.** All 6 `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` entries in
  `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` rewritten
  (`dev.luisgamas.uxnanmobile` for the Runner target and the
  derived `dev.luisgamas.uxnanmobile.RunnerTests` for the test target).
  `Info.plist` was unaffected (it uses `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`).
- **Firebase client config invalidated.** The locally-cached
  `android/app/google-services.json` and `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
  were pinned to the old `com.uxnan.mobile` bundle id and are now stale
  (`Firebase.initializeApp()` would refuse them). They are gitignored and
  were deleted; the Gradle Google Services plugin stays conditionally applied
  (`if (file("google-services.json").exists())`) so the build stays green.
  See `FOR-HUMAN.md` §2 — re-register / re-fetch under
  `dev.luisgamas.uxnanmobile` to re-enable push.
- **Spec updated.** `architecture/00-index.md` bootstrap row,
  `architecture/03-technical-reference.md` Firebase-registration steps,
  `uxnanmobile/README.md` package-id line, and `uxnanmobile/docs/architecture.md`
  iOS-bundle line all reflect the new id. The Dart package name `uxnan`
  (import path `package:uxnan/...`) is **unchanged** — it is a separate
  namespace from the Android / iOS bundle id.
- **Visible app name unchanged.** `android:label="Uxnan"`,
  `Info.plist` `CFBundleDisplayName=Uxnan`, and the user-facing brand "Uxnan"
  are unaffected.

### Changed — brand icon & splash rework
- **New brand mark + two theme variants.** The source SVGs were
  refreshed: `assets/images/logo.svg` (black mark on a white, rounded
  surface — the launcher mark), `assets/images/logo_nb.svg` (black
  stroke, for light surfaces) and the new `assets/images/logo_wnb.svg`
  (white stroke, for dark surfaces).
- **Launcher icon now derives from `logo.svg`.** Rasters regenerated:
  `logo-1024-1024.png` (square white background — iOS/macOS reject alpha
  corners and apply their own mask) and `logo_fg_1024.png` (padded mark
  on transparency, for the Android 8+ adaptive foreground over a flat
  white background layer). `flutter_launcher_icons` is now scoped to
  **Android + iOS only** (the "PC menu" icon lives in the desktop app),
  with `remove_alpha_ios: true`.
- **In-app marks pick the variant by surface, no runtime tint.** The
  devices-screen footer swaps `logo_nb`/`logo_wnb` by theme brightness
  instead of `ColorFilter`-tinting a single black mark.
- **Splash double-render fixed.** The mandatory Android 12+ SplashScreen
  API used to show the mark (cropped/zoomed into its circular icon mask)
  and then hard-cut to a differently sized Flutter overlay — a visible
  "two splashes" sequence. The Android 12+ splash icon is now a fully
  transparent image (`splash_blank.png`) over a white window, so the
  system splash is a plain white screen with no mark. The brand mark then
  appears exactly once — animated — in the `UxnanSplash` overlay over the
  same white surface, so it reads as a single splash. Pre-Android-12
  devices use the padded `logo_fg_1024.png` in the classic drawable splash.
- **`UxnanSplash` animation reworked.** The mark now enters at 70% scale
  rotated a half-turn (180°) and springs to 100% / 0° in place
  (`spatialSlow`), then the overlay fades out (`effectsSlow`). The intro is
  started on the first painted frame (not in `initState`) so the engine's
  init time can't fast-forward past it, and the minimum hold is 1200 ms so
  it always reads. Also fixes the dark-mode white-on-white invisibility —
  the overlay is always a flat white surface with the black mark.

### Added
- **Brand splash screen + launcher icons (Android, iOS, web).** The
  Uxnan brand mark is now the splash + home/launcher icon on every
  surface:
  - New `assets/images/logo.svg` (with white bg, splash fallback) and
    `assets/images/logo_nb.svg` (no bg, the brand mark used everywhere
    it needs to adapt to a theme); a 1024×1024 PNG
    (`assets/images/logo-1024-1024.png`) is generated alongside because
    `flutter_launcher_icons` / `flutter_native_splash` need a raster
    source.
  - `flutter_launcher_icons ^0.14.4` +
    `flutter_native_splash ^2.4.7` added as `dev_dependencies`; their
    config in `pubspec.yaml` regenerates the Android legacy + adaptive
    icons, the iOS `AppIcon.appiconset`, the iOS launch storyboard, the
    web PWA manifest + icons, and the Android 12+ SplashScreen API
    assets (`android12splash.png` + `values-v31`/`values-night-v31`
    styles).
  - New `UxnanSplash` overlay
    (`lib/presentation/widgets/uxnan_splash.dart`) shown on top of the
    first frame after the native splash hands off — the logo scales in
    with the M3E `spatialDefault` spring (slight overshoot) and the
    overlay fades out with `effectsSlow` once `onReady` resolves. A
    900 ms minimum hold guarantees the splash reads as a deliberate
    moment on fast devices. Black-on-white in light mode,
    white-on-white in dark mode via a `ColorFilter` (no second SVG
    variant needed). Wired in `app.dart` via a new `_AppShell` that
    composes the router output with `_PushHost` + `UxnanSplash` in a
    `Stack`.

### Changed
- **Devices-screen footer is now the brand mark + ALPHA caption.**
  `_BrandingFooter` no longer renders the localized "Uxnan Mobile"
  text; instead it shows a small SVG of the brand mark (28 dp tall,
  theme-aware via `ColorFilter`) with the existing ALPHA pill kept as
  the caption underneath.
- **Custom themes as a library (multi-selectable + JSON import/export of
  many themes).** The personalization screen's previous 4-segment
  `SegmentedButton` (System / Light / Dark / Custom) is replaced with a
  **3-segment** picker + a **"Use a custom theme"** master switch + a
  collapsible library. The library ships **2 built-in example themes**
  ("Midnight" — leans dark, deep blue-violet seed;
  "Sandstone" — leans light, warm amber seed) so a first-run user always
  has something selectable before authoring anything; the master switch
  controls whether the app applies the user's selected theme (when on)
  or follows System/Light/Dark (when off). When the switch is on, the
  segmented picker is disabled; when off, the library is rendered greyed
  out (and its rows are non-interactive via `IgnorePointer`), so the
  two states are visually + functionally exclusive. Each row in the
  library shows a radio (the active theme), the theme's name, an
  **Active** or **Built-in** badge, a 4-dot color preview (light
  primary + dark primary + light surface + dark surface) and an
  `IconSurfaceMenu` (Edit / Export JSON / Delete — Delete is disabled
  for built-ins). Below the rows, library-level actions: **Import
  theme** (paste a single theme JSON OR a JSON array — the typical
  *Export all* payload — and assign fresh ids when an imported id
  collides with an existing entry), **Export all themes** (copy the
  whole library to the clipboard as a JSON array), and **Reset
  library** (drop every authored theme, restore the built-in seed,
  flip the switch off). State model:
  - New providers in `application_providers.dart`:
    `customThemesLibraryProvider` (`List<CustomTheme>`, seeded with
    the built-ins on first hydrate, persisted under
    `uxnan.appearance.customThemes` as a JSON array),
    `activeCustomThemeIdProvider` (`String?`, persisted under
    `uxnan.appearance.activeCustomThemeId`),
    `useCustomThemeProvider` (`bool`, persisted under
    `uxnan.appearance.useCustomTheme`).
  - `customThemeSettingProvider` becomes a derived
    `Provider<CustomTheme?>` (was a `Notifier<CustomTheme?>`) — it
    resolves to the active theme when the switch is on and an id is
    selected, so `app.dart` + `themeSourceSettingProvider` keep their
    existing contract.
  - Legacy `uxnan.appearance.customTheme` is migrated into the library
    on first hydrate (single-shot; the key is removed after migration).
  - `CustomThemeEditorScreen` saves via
    `customThemesLibraryProvider.notifier.upsert(theme)` instead of
    the old singular setter, so editing the active theme keeps it
    active after save.
  - `isBuiltInCustomThemeId(id)` (constant
    `kBuiltInThemeIdPrefix = 'uxnan.builtin.'`) gates the Delete menu
    item + the per-row deletion; the two shipped themes are read-only.
  - `AppearancePreferencesStore` gains
    `readCustomThemesLibrary` / `writeCustomThemesLibrary`,
    `readActiveCustomThemeId` / `writeActiveCustomThemeId`, and
    `readUseCustomTheme` / `writeUseCustomTheme`. The legacy
    `readCustomTheme` / `writeCustomTheme` are kept for the one-shot
    migration and the existing storage tests.
  - `personalization_screen.dart` is rewritten: `ThemeModeOption` drops
    its `custom` variant; `_ThemeModeOptionSelector` is 3 segments and
    takes a `disabled` flag; `_CustomThemesSection` hosts the master
    `SwitchListTile` + `_CustomThemesCollapsible` (an `ExpansionTile`
    with the per-theme rows and the library-level action tiles).
  - Tests in `personalization_screen_test.dart` are rewritten to cover
    the new shape: 3-segment picker, switch + collapsible + built-in
    examples, language persistence, switch-on + tap-to-activate flow,
    and pre-seeded active-theme hydration with the *Active* badge.
    All 349 unit + widget tests pass.
  - **Spec drift:** `architecture/02c-implementation-guide.md` §3.1
    ("Temas personalizables") is rewritten to describe the library
    model (state shape, picker + collapsible UX, editor contract,
    storage, JSON wire shape for both single-theme and library-array
    payloads, redesign rationale).
- **Custom themes replace the curated accent picker.** The personalization
  screen no longer offers a closed 7-swatch palette (blue / purple / pink
  / red / orange / green / teal). Instead, the theme-mode selector is a
  4-segment `SegmentedButton` (System / Light / Dark / **Custom**);
  selecting *Custom* (when a custom theme is present) flips the source
  to `ThemeSource.custom` and opens a new
  **`CustomThemeEditorScreen`** that lets the user fine-tune **every
  public Material 3 color role** (46 roles, grouped: Primary,
  Secondary, Tertiary, Error, Surface, Outline & inverse) for both
  brightnesses independently. Two helpers — *Reset brightness* (regenerate
  one side from the current `primary` via `ColorScheme.fromSeed`) and
  *Derive from seed* (pick a seed and regenerate one side from scratch) —
  give the user a fast path when they don't want to tweak every role.
  The editor ships an inline HSV color picker (`ColorPickerSheet`) plus
  hex entry; the visual baseline (the hand-tuned brand palette) is
  preserved for users that never personalize. *Export* copies the theme
  JSON to the clipboard and opens a pretty-printed, selectable dialog so
  the JSON can be shared via any system share sheet; *Import* parses a
  pasted JSON into the working theme (the user's current name +
  description are preserved across an import).
  - New: `domain/value_objects/custom_theme.dart` — `CustomTheme`
    (id / name / description / schemaVersion + light + dark) and
    `CustomThemeColors` (the flat role map). Builders
    (`CustomTheme.derivedFromSeed`), copy-with (`withLightColors`,
    `withDarkColors`, `withMetadata`), and a JSON codec
    (`toJson` / `fromJson` / `toJsonString` / `fromJsonString`)
    that round-trips every role as `#AARRGGBB` (also accepts legacy
    integer ARGB) and is tolerant of unknown / missing keys so a
    hand-edited or older document still loads.
  - New: `presentation/screens/settings/custom_theme_editor_screen.dart`
    — the full editor (metadata, brightness tabs, grouped role list,
    export / import, derive-from-seed).
  - New: `presentation/widgets/color_picker.dart` — `ColorPickerSheet`,
    an HSV-based picker (`Slider`s + hex field + preview) used by the
    editor's per-role editing and by the *Derive from seed* dialog.
  - Removed: `domain/value_objects/accent_color.dart`
    (`AccentPalette` + `AccentColorId` + 7 hard-coded seeds + the
    tolerant id parser).
  - Removed: `AccentSetting` notifier and `accentSettingProvider` from
    `application_providers.dart`.
  - Removed: l10n keys `accentBlue` … `accentTeal` (en + es).
  - `presentation/theme/uxnan_theme.dart` —
    `buildUxnanTheme({themeSource, customTheme, brightness})`. Two
    mutually exclusive paths: `ThemeSource.brand` →
    hand-tuned palette (identical visual baseline to a fresh install);
    `ThemeSource.custom` → the user's `CustomTheme.colorScheme` /
    `.darkColorScheme`. A transient null `customTheme` while the source
    is `custom` degrades to brand rather than crashing the theme — the
    UI never reaches that state, but it keeps a misconfigured provider
    recoverable.
  - `infrastructure/storage/appearance_preferences_store.dart` —
    `readCustomTheme()` / `writeCustomTheme(CustomTheme?)` under
    `uxnan.appearance.customTheme`. Tolerant parser (a malformed
    document yields null → brand baseline) and a clear-the-key path
    for `writeCustomTheme(null)`.
  - `presentation/providers/application_providers.dart` — new
    `CustomThemeSetting` notifier + `customThemeSettingProvider` and
    `ThemeSourceSetting` notifier + `themeSourceSettingProvider`. The
    source derives from the presence of a custom theme (no separate
    key on disk; the two stay in lock-step).
  - `presentation/screens/settings/personalization_screen.dart` —
    4-segment `SegmentedButton<ThemeModeOption>` (System / Light / Dark
    / Custom); while no custom theme is persisted the *Custom* segment
    is disabled (the user must author one first). When *Custom* is
    active, a card below the picker shows the active theme's name +
    description + *Edit* / *Reset* tiles.
  - `app.dart` — watches `themeSourceSettingProvider` +
    `customThemeSettingProvider` and passes them to `buildUxnanTheme`
    for both `theme` and `darkTheme`.
  - `test/widget/presentation/file_viewer_screen_test.dart` — updated
    the test helper to pass the new required `themeSource` argument.
  - Tests: 8 new in `uxnan_theme_test.dart` (brand baseline +
    dynamic from-theme for light + dark; custom source with null theme
    falls back to brand); 14 new in `custom_theme_test.dart` (JSON
    round-trip via `toJson` / `fromJson` and `toJsonString` /
    `fromJsonString`, partial / unknown role tolerance, hex (RGB + ARGB)
    and int ARGB parsing, malformed input, derived builders,
    `toColorScheme` role coverage, `freshId` uniqueness); 7 new in
    `appearance_preferences_custom_theme_test.dart` (read null,
    write + read, clear via null, unparseable → null, namespacing,
    isolation from other appearance keys, role-preserving round-trip);
    5 rewritten in `personalization_screen_test.dart` (4-segment
    picker, *Custom* disabled on first run, *Custom* enabled when a
    theme is persisted, language persistence still works, active
    theme card renders the persisted theme's name + description).
    **354 unit + widget tests passing, all green.**
  - **Spec drift:** `architecture/02c-implementation-guide.md` §3.1
    replaces the *"Colores de acento personalizables"* section with the
    full *"Temas personalizables"* spec (builder signature, picker UX,
    editor structure, storage, JSON wire shape, redesign rationale);
    `architecture/00-index.md` status table flips the entry from
    *"7 swatches curados"* to *"Custom themes (temas personalizables)"*.
    `FOR-DEV.md` marks the previous accent-picker item as superseded.

- **Library-level actions live outside the collapsible themes tile.**
  *+ New theme*, *Import theme*, *Export all themes* and *Reset library*
  are no longer nested inside the `ExpansionTile`'s children — they're
  rendered as siblings of the tile so they stay one tap away whether
  the themes list is folded or open. The collapsible now only hosts the
  per-theme rows; its persisted expand/collapse state (see Fixed
  below) keeps controlling the row visibility. The `_CustomThemesSection`
  in `personalization_screen.dart` lays out: master switch → optional
  description (when empty) → `ExpansionTile` (rows only) → 4 action
  rows separated by thin dividers. New widget test
  (`library-level actions are visible without expanding the themes
  tile`) locks the new layout in.

- **Custom theme JSON exports can now save to a file (in addition to
  the clipboard).** Every export surface — the per-row *Export* menu
  item, the library-level *Export all themes* action, and the editor's
  *Export* button — now lets the user choose between *Copy to clipboard*
  (existing behaviour) and *Save to file* via the native share sheet
  (`share_plus` + a temp file under `getTemporaryDirectory()`; the
  sheet lets the user pick Files / Drive / email / any registered share
  target). The per-theme payload is named
  `uxnan-theme-<slug>.json` and the library payload
  `uxnan-themes-<YYYYMMDD-HHmm>.json`. Helper:
  `lib/presentation/screens/settings/theme_export.dart`
  (`shareThemeJsonFile`). New `share_plus` dependency in `pubspec.yaml`.
  New l10n keys: `personalizationCustomThemeExportCopy`,
  `personalizationCustomThemeExportFile`,
  `personalizationCustomThemesSaved`,
  `personalizationCustomThemesSaveFailed`,
  `customThemeEditorDefaultName`, `customThemeEditorSaved`,
  `customThemeEditorSaveFailed`, `customThemeEditorShareFile`,
  `actionApply` (en + es).

- **+ New theme picker — seed color + brightness are now user input.**
  Tapping *+ New theme* opens a small dialog (HSV preview + hue /
  saturation / value sliders + a Light / Dark segmented button + Cancel
  / Apply) instead of silently reusing the active app's primary as the
  seed and always defaulting to the Light tab. The picked seed is
  forced to the resulting theme's `primary` (and Material's
  `ColorScheme.fromSeed` derives every other role from it); both
  brightnesses are seeded. The editor opens on the brightness the user
  picked. New l10n keys:
  `personalizationCustomThemeNewDialogTitle`,
  `personalizationCustomThemeNewDialogBody` (en + es).

### Removed
- `domain/value_objects/accent_color.dart` (`AccentPalette` /
  `AccentColorId` and the 7 curated swatches).
- `accentSettingProvider` (Riverpod notifier that drove
  `ColorScheme.fromSeed` for non-default accents).
- `infrastructure/storage/appearance_preferences_store.dart` keys
  `readAccentId` / `writeAccentId` (replaced by
  `readCustomTheme` / `writeCustomTheme`).
- **Unused l10n key `appTitleMobile`** (en + es). The key only fed the
  old footer text we replaced with the brand mark; the descriptions
  in the .arb files were updated to reflect that.
- l10n keys `accentBlue` … `accentTeal` (en + es) — replaced by the
  `customTheme*` key set on the editor + section headers.
- Tests `test/unit/domain/value_objects/accent_color_test.dart` and
  `test/unit/infrastructure/storage/appearance_preferences_accent_test.dart`
  (the equivalent coverage now lives in `custom_theme_test.dart` +
  `appearance_preferences_custom_theme_test.dart`).

### Fixed
- **Conversation no longer opens at the top — scroll position is
  remembered.** Opening a thread always reset the timeline to the top,
  forcing users who had scrolled up to read older context to scroll all the
  way back down (or tap *Jump to latest*) every time they left and re-entered.
  A new session-scoped `ConversationScrollStore`
  (`lib/presentation/providers/conversation_scroll_store.dart`, an
  in-memory `Map<threadId, { offset, atBottom }>`) records the current
  pixel offset while the user scrolls, and `ConversationScreen` now
  restores it once on first content (a one-time, idempotent
  `_restoreScroll` guarded by `_restoredScroll`, re-applied on the next
  frame to catch late layout — variable-height messages / images that
  grow `maxScrollExtent`). When the user was at (or near) the bottom on
  close, the restore follows the newest message instead of pinning a now-
  stale offset. The store is intentionally in-memory only (per session):
  a saved pixel offset only maps cleanly onto the same rendered content,
  which a cross-restart resync can change. Pairs with the existing
  *Jump to latest* button — the button still gets you to the newest
  message manually; the restore makes the common case (returning to a
  thread) just work. New: 3 tests in
  `test/unit/presentation/conversation_scroll_store_test.dart` (null until
  saved, round-trip, overwrite). **346 unit + widget tests passing, all
  green.**

### Fixed
- **File browser's git-status colours are now live across the app.**
  Previously `FileBrowserManager` cached the per-cwd `git/status` map and
  only refreshed it on `loadRoot` / `toggleDirectory` / `writeFile`, so a
  commit made elsewhere on the same PC (the git screen, a CLI `git commit`,
  a pull on the bridge) left the browser painting stale colours until the
  user navigated away and back. The browser now listens to a new
  `GitStatusBus` (a process-wide broadcast owned by
  `gitStatusBusProvider`) that `GitActionManager` and `FileBrowserManager`
  both publish to; every successful `git/status` fetch pushes a
  `GitStatusChange` onto the bus, and every manager holding that cwd
  repaints from the payload. No more stale `modified` colours on a tree
  that has actually been committed. The bus is generic — any future
  consumer can subscribe without touching the producer side.
  - New: `lib/domain/value_objects/git/git_status_change.dart`
    (`GitStatusChange { cwd, state }` value object).
  - New: `lib/application/services/git_status_bus.dart`
    (`GitStatusBus` — broadcast `Stream<GitStatusChange>`, `emit`,
    `dispose`; safe no-op after close).
  - `lib/application/managers/git_action_manager.dart` — emits on the
    bus after every successful `refreshStatus(cwd)` (the single point
    that issues the `git/status` RPC).
  - `lib/application/managers/file_browser_manager.dart` — subscribes
    once; repaints any managed cwd from a bus event whose `cwd` matches;
    also publishes on the bus from its own `refreshGitStatus` (with a
    minimal `GitRepoState` carrying only the `changedFiles`, since that
    is the only field the colour treatment needs).
  - `lib/presentation/providers/application_providers.dart` — new
    `gitStatusBusProvider` (one instance per app, disposed with the
    providers); `gitActionManagerProvider` and `fileBrowserManagerProvider`
    are wired to it.
  - Tests: 5 in `git_status_bus_test.dart` (broadcast, no replay, no-op
    after dispose, payload preservation, ordering), 2 added to
    `git_action_manager_test.dart` (`refreshStatus` emits;
    `commit` propagates), 3 added to `file_browser_manager_test.dart`
    (bus repaint for a managed cwd, ignored for an unknown cwd, own
    refresh publishes the new state). **340 unit + widget tests
    passing, all green.**

### Fixed
- **Custom themes: deleting an authored theme no longer crashes with
  `Bad state: Using "ref" when a widget is about to or has been
  unmounted`.** `_CustomThemeRow._delete` showed a confirm dialog
  asynchronously; once the user confirmed, the library removed the
  theme and the row unmounted before the follow-up
  `ref.read(activeCustomThemeIdProvider…).set(null)` /
  `ref.read(useCustomThemeProvider…).set(false)` ran — those late
  reads tripped Riverpod's `assertNotDisposed`. The fix captures the
  three notifiers + the local `isActive` flag into local fields
  *before* the first `await`, so the post-delete cleanup operates on
  stable handles. New widget test (`deleting an authored theme does
  not crash when the row unmounts`) covers the path.

- **New custom themes now actually apply to the app.** Tapping *+ New
  theme* and confirming the seed+brightness dialog used to leave the
  new theme sitting in the library waiting to be tapped — the
  `themeMode` (System / Light / Dark) was untouched, so a brand-new
  dark theme was hidden behind a `system`-mode + system-brightness-
  light combo. The editor's *Save* now detects a fresh id (not yet
  in the library) and atomically (a) upserts, (b) sets
  `activeCustomThemeIdProvider`, (c) flips `useCustomThemeProvider` on,
  and (d) syncs `themeModeSettingProvider` to the brightness the user
  picked in the new-theme dialog — so the resulting dark/light custom
  theme is what the app actually shows on pop. Editing an existing
  theme keeps the existing activation + themeMode untouched. New
  widget test (`creating a new dark theme applies it with
  ThemeMode.dark on save`) covers the path.

- **Custom themes library collapsible remembers its state across
  restarts.** The ExpansionTile's expanded/collapsed state was owned
  by the widget itself, so it always reset to collapsed on reopen. A
  new `customThemesExpandedProvider`
  (`Notifier<bool>` + `AppearancePreferencesStore.readCustomThemesExpanded`
  / `writeCustomThemesExpanded`, persisted under
  `uxnan.appearance.customThemesExpanded`) drives an `ExpansibleController`
  from the screen's state class. Toggle → provider → disk; first
  build → disk → controller. New widget test (`the library expansion
  state persists across restarts`) covers the path.

### Added
- **Custom accent colors (Personalization → Accent color).** The
  personalization screen now offers a curated palette of **7 swatches**
  (`blue` / `purple` / `pink` / `red` / `orange` / `green` / `teal`)
  in place of the previous *"Coming soon"* placeholder. The whole
  `ColorScheme` is derived from the picked swatch via
  `ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: accent.seed, brightness: …)` for
  **both** light and dark, so every M3 role (primary, secondary,
  tertiary, surface containers, outline, …) stays coherent and
  harmonious — exactly the *"larger theming change"* `FOR-DEV.md`
  called for, and a direct fix for the visual incoherence a first cut
  that only overrode `primary` had. The brand `blue` keeps the
  hand-tuned palette (no visual regression for users that never
  personalize); every other swatch switches to the dynamic scheme.
  The pick is persisted in `shared_preferences` under
  `uxnan.appearance.accentId` (only the id; the seed is resolved
  from the immutable `AccentPalette`, so adding a swatch is
  non-breaking for old saves and `AccentPalette.fromId` degrades
  unknown ids to the default).
  - `domain/value_objects/accent_color.dart` — `AccentColorId` + the
    closed `AccentPalette` (7 swatches with M3-friendly chroma).
  - `infrastructure/storage/appearance_preferences_store.dart` —
    `readAccentId()` / `writeAccentId(String?)` (replaces the
    `FOR-DEV:` reservation in the doc comment).
  - `presentation/providers/application_providers.dart` —
    `AccentSetting` notifier + `accentSettingProvider`
    (Riverpod 3.x manual, same hydrate-then-persist pattern as
    `ThemeModeSetting` / `LocaleSetting`).
  - `presentation/theme/uxnan_theme.dart` —
    `buildUxnanTheme({ accent: AccentColorId? })`; brand blue →
    hand-tuned palette, anything else → dynamic from-seed scheme.
  - `presentation/screens/settings/personalization_screen.dart` —
    `_AccentPicker` (M3 list of swatch rows, M3E chrome), replacing
    the `_AccentComingSoon` placeholder.
  - `app.dart` — watches `accentSettingProvider` and passes the seed
    to `buildUxnanTheme` for both `theme` and `darkTheme`.
  - l10n (en + es): `accentBlue` … `accentTeal`.
  - Tests: 8 in `accent_color_test.dart` (palette, tolerant parser,
    equality), 7 in `appearance_preferences_accent_test.dart`
    (store round-trip, namespacing, isolation from the other
    appearance keys), 7 new + 2 pre-existing in
    `uxnan_theme_test.dart` (default-palette preservation, dynamic
    from-seed for every non-default swatch, light/dark coherence,
    determinism), 4 in `personalization_screen_test.dart` (7
    swatches render, default is pre-selected, tap persists, language
    flow still works). **319 unit + widget tests passing, all green.**
  - **Spec drift:** `architecture/02c-implementation-guide.md` §3.1
    documents the two-path rule (brand-blue → hand-tuned;
    non-default → from-seed for both brightnesses);
    `architecture/00-index.md` status table flips the item to
    ✅ Hecho. `FOR-DEV.md` marks the entry as DONE (on-device
    visual review of the swatch picker is the remaining UX step).

### Changed
- **`flutter_markdown` → `flutter_markdown_plus`.** The original
  `flutter_markdown 0.7.x` package is marked discontinued on pub.dev;
  replaced with `flutter_markdown_plus 1.0.7` (the maintained fork
  published by the Flutter team + community). The API is a
  drop-in replacement — `MarkdownBody`, `Markdown`, and
  `MarkdownStyleSheet` keep their exact signatures — so the only
  changes are the `pubspec.yaml` entry and the package import in
  `file_viewer_screen.dart`, `message_content_view.dart`, and the
  matching test. The pubspec resolution dropped `flutter_markdown
  0.7.7+1` automatically.

### Fixed
- **Bridge connection survives background → resume.** Backgrounding the
  app could leave it stuck "disconnected" on reopen (the OS suspends/drops
  the socket and nothing re-checked on resume). On resume the app now calls
  `SessionCoordinator.resume()`: if a reconnect backoff was pending it
  retries **immediately** (new wake mechanism — `resume` interrupts the
  backoff delay instead of waiting it out), if it believed it was connected
  it round-trips `bridge/status` to catch a silently-dropped socket, and if
  disconnected it kicks a reconnect. The open conversation also re-syncs
  (`ThreadManager.resyncActive`) so messages that landed while away appear
  without leaving + re-entering it.

### Added
- **Cold-start auto-reconnect + history recovery.** On launch (incl. after
  an unexpected close) the app reconnects to the most-recently-used PC
  (`lastSeen`, best-effort, with a backoff fallback) so the bridge session
  is restored automatically; the existing `turn/list` re-sync then recovers
  the thread's messages from the bridge (local drift history is preserved
  across restarts and reconciled by the deterministic assistant id).
- **Jump-to-latest button in the conversation.** Scrolling up in a long
  or streaming conversation now reveals a small circular button (over the
  timeline, above the composer) that springs in (NE small-element motion)
  and jumps back to the newest message in one tap; it hides again near the
  bottom. Driven by a scroll listener (`_showJumpToBottom`) reusing the
  existing `_scrollToBottom`.
- **Agent plan / to-do lists now render (plan mode).** When an agent emits
  its task list, it shows as a checklist in the turn (the `PlanContent`
  decoder + `_PlanCard` already existed; the bridge now maps each agent's
  plan/to-do tool to a `plan` content block — see the bridge changelog).
  No mobile change beyond confirming the end-to-end render.
- **mDNS "Browse nearby bridges" in manual pairing.** The manual-code
  screen now has a **Browse nearby bridges** action that opens a sheet
  listing bridges advertising `_uxnan._tcp` on the LAN (a new
  `BridgeDiscoveryService` over the native `nsd` plugin — NsdManager /
  Bonjour, which handles the Android multicast lock). Picking one
  pre-fills the host; typing the host stays the fallback. TXT/addr
  parsing (`parseDiscoveredBridge`, prefers the advertised `addr`/`port`,
  falls back to the resolved IPv4 + SRV port) is unit-tested. Adds the
  `nsd` dependency; Android `INTERNET` + `CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE`
  permissions and iOS `NSBonjourServices` + `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`
  (copy review tracked in `FOR-HUMAN.md`).
- **Session info sheet ("resume from the CLI").** The conversation
  overflow menu's **Session info** item (replacing the bare "Copy thread
  ID") opens a sheet showing the copyable **Thread ID** and the agent's
  **native session id** (fetched lazily via `thread/read`,
  `ThreadManager.readAgentSessionId`; absent on older bridges/agents),
  with a hint that they let you resume the conversation from the agent's
  CLI on the PC.
- **Per-thread approval mode now persists server-side.** The approval
  (access) mode picked in the turn-tools sheet is seeded from the bridge
  on open (`ThreadManager.readAccessMode` via `thread/read`, the source
  of truth) and persisted on change (`ThreadManager.setAccessMode` →
  `thread/setAccessMode`), so the per-thread choice survives a restart and
  is shared across devices. (Enforcing the mode per turn — mapping it to
  each agent's permission flag — is a tracked follow-up.)
- **Remote history pagination (newest-page open + backward paging).**
  Opening a thread now pulls only the **newest** page of turns
  (`turn/list { fromEnd: true, limit: 20 }`) instead of the oldest page,
  and "Show earlier messages" pages **backward** over the bridge: it
  widens the local window first, then fetches the previous turn page by
  an explicit offset cursor derived from the bridge's new `total`,
  persisting older answers below the current min `orderIndex`. `hasMore`
  reflects local-window OR remote-offset. Backward-compatible (an older
  bridge that omits `total` falls back to local windowing only). Requires
  the bridge/shared `turn/list` changes below. Covered by a manager
  back-paging test.
- **Project filter chips on the threads list (implemented, disabled in
  the UI).** A PC hosting several repos can be sliced by project: a
  horizontal chip bar filtering by a project key (`projectId` when set,
  otherwise the working `cwd`, labelled by the folder basename),
  composing with the agent filter. The code (`_ProjectFilterBar` +
  grouping helpers) is complete but **intentionally not shown** — a flat
  chip bar isn't the right surface; it's gated behind
  `_projectFilterEnabled` (`false`) until a dedicated advanced
  filters / organization view exists. Flip the flag from that view to
  enable; no other change needed.
- **Sort + density thread-list preference now persists.** The list
  ordering (created / name / folder) and the compact-density toggle were
  in-memory `StatefulWidget` fields; they're now persisted on-device
  (`ThreadListPreferencesStore`, keys `uxnan.threads.sort` /
  `uxnan.threads.compact`) and exposed as `threadSortProvider` /
  `threadDensityCompactProvider`, so the active and archived thread lists
  share one persisted choice that survives restarts. Covered by a store
  round-trip test.
- **Inline file editing in the file viewer.** Text files (UTF-8, not
  images or binaries) now show an **Edit** action in the viewer's top
  bar. Editing opens a full-height monospace editor over the raw file
  content; saving writes the buffer back through the existing
  `workspace/applyPatch` RPC (a single `modify` change — no new bridge
  contract) and immediately re-fetches the file so the git diff and the
  browser tree colours repaint with the new changes. An unsaved buffer
  prompts a discard confirmation on close / system-back (`PopScope`).
  New manager method `FileBrowserManager.writeFile`; new strings
  `fileViewer{Edit,Save,Saved,SaveFailed,Discard,DiscardTitle,DiscardBody,KeepEditing}`.

### Changed
- **File-browser folders now colour by their contents' git status.**
  A directory whose (possibly still-collapsed) descendants contain
  changes now paints its name + folder icon: `modified` when any tracked
  descendant changed, `untracked` when the only changes underneath are
  untracked. Previously only files coloured, so a changed file deep in
  the tree left every parent folder neutral until expanded. Implemented
  as an aggregate scan over the `git/status` map in `FileBrowserManager`
  (`_dirStatus`), applied to directory nodes on build and repatch.

### Fixed
- **File viewer content now scrolls *under* the transparent app bar.**
  The previous `Column([SizedBox(topInset), Expanded(body)])` layout
  pinned the scrollable body *below* the bar, so the bar always sat over
  a blank `surface` band and read as a solid app bar. The body now fills
  the `Stack` and each scrollable leaf (`_CodeBody`, `_MarkdownBody`,
  `FileDiffViewer`) pads its own top by `topInset`, so content scrolls
  beneath the gradient veil — matching `ConversationScreen` /
  `FileBrowserScreen` / `GitScreen`.
- **File viewer no longer renders a solid band under the app bar.**
  The viewer's body used `Padding(top: topInset, child: _buildBody)`
  inside the `Stack`, which painted the `surface` background of the
  Scaffold into the gap between the bar's gradient and the content.
  The new body is a `Column` whose first child is a transparent
  `SizedBox(height: topInset)` (no painted background), so the area
  between the bar and the content is see-through and the gradient
  dissolves naturally into the surface. Matches `ConversationScreen`
  / `FileBrowserScreen` / `GitScreen` exactly.
- **`NeTopBar` gradient softened.** Peaked at `surface` (alpha 1.0)
  in the original; now peaks at 0.75 and dissolves faster
  (`0.75 → 0.45 → 0`, stops `[0, 0.5, 1]`). Affects every screen
  that uses `NeTopBar` (file browser, file viewer, git screen,
  conversation, branch picker). The bar still gives the
  back / actions a stable background but reads as a *veil* over the
  content instead of a solid app-bar band.

### Added
- **Horizontal padding for file viewer text content.** The text body
  (code, markdown source, markdown preview, diff, image, binary,
  error) now wraps its content in `EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal:
  UxnanSpacing.lg)` so the rendered text doesn't kiss the screen
  edges on narrow viewports. Previously the text went from
  `padding: 0` to `padding: 0` (only the highlight theme's own
  internal padding kept it off the edge, and only sometimes). Same
  `lg` (16 dp) inset the rest of the app uses for content surfaces.
- **File viewer / file browser / git screen — `NeTopBar` no longer
  overflows on phone widths.** All three screens overlaid the bar with
  `Positioned(top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, child: NeTopBar(...))` inside
  a `Scaffold(body: Stack(children: [...]))` that defaulted to
  `StackFit.loose`. With loose fit the stack's own size is the union
  of its non-Positioned children — and on the file viewer the body
  is a `MarkdownBody` whose intrinsic width is much smaller than the
  screen, so the Stack collapsed to ~131 dp on a 360 dp viewport. The
  Positioned inherited that narrow width (`left: 0, right: 0` on a
  zero-width stack gives the bar zero horizontal room), the `Row` of
  leading + title + actions tried to fit 4 × 48 dp `IconSurface`s
  into ~131 dp, and the user saw a `RenderFlex overflowed by 86/73
  pixels` exception. Switching all three screens to
  `Stack(fit: StackFit.expand, children: [...])` makes the stack
  fill the Scaffold body, so the bar gets the full row width.
  A regression test (`file_viewer_screen_test.dart`) pumps the viewer
  with three real markdown samples (CLAUDE.md → "AGENTS.md", a full
  README with headings + lists + code blocks, and a long paragraph)
  on a 1080×2160 / 3.0 viewport and asserts no captured layout
  exceptions.
- **File viewer chrome — bar gradient softened.** The bar's
  `LinearGradient` peaked at `surface` (opaque) which read as a
  solid app-bar band on top of the file tree. Now peaks at
  `surface.withValues(alpha: 0.85)` and dissolves faster
  (`0.55 → 0`) so the bar feels like a *veil* over the content, not
  a solid panel. Affects every screen that uses `NeTopBar` (file
  browser, file viewer, git screen, conversation, branch picker) so
  the whole app now shares the lighter bar tone.
- **`GitScreen` now uses `BouncingScrollPhysics`.** The
  `CustomScrollView` in the file list was missing the `physics:`
  argument and so fell back to `ClampingScrollPhysics` on Android —
  the user couldn't see the iOS-style overscroll bounce the rest of
  the app uses. Added `physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent:
  AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics())` to match `ConversationScreen`,
  `FileBrowserScreen`, and `NeScaffold`.
- **Hardcoded colors replaced with theme tokens.** `_PrimaryActionButton`
  (git screen) used a raw `Colors.white` literal for the busy spinner;
  replaced with `colors.onPrimary` (the semantic token that already
  drives the icon and the surface). `_MarkdownBody` (file viewer)
  used raw `Color(0xFF282C34)` / `Color(0xFFFAFAFA)` literals for
  the codeblock background; replaced with
  `colors.surfaceContainerHighest` / `colors.surfaceContainerHigh`
  so the block follows the active M3 scheme. New rule going forward:
  never inline a hex literal in a widget — always reference
  `UxnanColors.*` or `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.*`.

### Changed
- **Git status now paints newly expanded subdirectories.** The file
  browser only applied `git/status` to children that were loaded in
  the initial root listing — when the user expanded a deeper
  directory, its children were created with `gitStatus = null`, so
  the new entries rendered in the neutral `onSurface` colour instead
  of the git-status colour. `_buildInitialChildren` now takes the
  cached git-status map and pre-paints each file the same way the
  root does; `toggleDirectory` forwards the map when it fetches a
  new sub-listing. Visible effect: the entire tree, not just the
  root level, reflects `git status`.
- **File viewer's app bar matches the conversation chrome.** The
  file viewer's title used `titleMedium`; every other NE-styled
  screen (`ConversationScreen`, `GitScreen`, file browser) uses
  `titleLarge.copyWith(fontSize: 20)`. The viewer now uses the same
  size — the back, title, and trailing action row are visually
  indistinguishable from the rest of the app.
- **`GitScreen` is now a true Neural Expressive surface.** The
  screen kept using M3 widgets (`Card.outlined`, `Card.filled`,
  `Checkbox`, `IconButton`, `IconButton.filled`, `ListTile`,
  `InkWell`) while every other screen was rebuilt against NE — the
  result was a card-style chrome that didn't match the file browser,
  conversation, or new-conversation dialog. The screen now uses:
    - `_NeSurface` (a new shared widget) in place of
      `Card.filled` / `Card.outlined` — rounded 20 dp corners,
      `surfaceContainerHigh` fill, optional thin outline.
    - `_NeCheckbox` in place of M3's `Checkbox` — a 24 dp circular
      surface on `primary` when selected, the empty-box / check /
      dash glyph in the same M3E scale spring as the rest of the
      bar.
    - `IconSurface` in place of every `IconButton` (refresh,
      expand-all, undo-commit, etc.) — same round press feedback,
      same tooltip contract.
    - `_PrimaryActionButton` in place of `IconButton.filled` for
      the commit / push primary slot — keeps the round ripple that
      `IconButton.filled` breaks, supports a busy-spinner overlay,
      and accepts the `Badge.count` for the push-ahead count.
    - `_BranchPickerRow` in place of `ListTile` for the
      branch-switcher bottom sheet — a tappable row with the same
      M3E ripple.
    - `_ExpandableRow` for the whole file card so a tap anywhere
      on the row (not just the chevron) toggles expansion.
  The file's *name* in the row now picks up the git-status colour
  (matching the file browser's tile), so the row reads at a glance
  before reading the icon.

### Fixed
- **File browser sends absolute paths to the bridge.** The bridge's
  `workspace/list` does `resolve(cwd)` server-side, so a relative `cwd`
  resolves against the project's CWD, not the worktree / sub-folder the
  user is browsing — the visible symptom was `FormatException: Invalid
  workspace/list response` whenever the user opened a directory under a
  worktree. `FileBrowserManager` now joins the workspace's absolute root
  (the `cwd` from the active thread) with each expanded directory's
  relative path before sending. `loadRoot` and `toggleDirectory` both
  honour this convention. `FileBrowserManager`'s docstring documents
  the path contract.
- **Folder/file load errors no longer crash the browser.** A
  `workspace/list` failure (directory removed, permission denied, a
  stale cwd) used to surface as an unhandled `FormatException`. The
  manager now catches the underlying `RpcError` (or any
  `FileListingException` from a malformed payload) and stores the
  message on the affected `FileTreeNode.error`. The directory is shown
  collapsed with its error visible; the root failure shows the
  existing `_ErrorBody`. `readFile` / `readImage` throw a dedicated
  `FileReadException` (also caught by the viewer) so the existing
  error state still renders correctly.
- **Toggles in the file browser now reflect their state in the app
  bar.** The previous overflow-menu `Switch`es rebuilt only when the
  popup reopened (the `PopupMenuItem` doesn't watch the provider), so
  the user saw no visual feedback until the menu was closed. Both
  "show file extensions" and "show hidden files" are now `IconSurface`s
  in the app bar with `selected: bool` (matching the diff-toggle
  pattern the file viewer already uses) — the secondary-container
  tone + `onSecondaryContainer` foreground make the active state
  immediately visible.
- **File browser / viewer chrome matches the rest of the app.** Both
  screens now use the same `Scaffold` + `Stack` + `NeTopBar` overlay
  pattern that `ConversationScreen` and `GitScreen` use, with
  `BouncingScrollPhysics` + `AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics` on the
  tree list (matches `NeScaffold`). The gradiente del app bar, el
  scroll-veil inferior y la separación con el status bar now match
  the conversation screen exactly.

### Added
- **Workspace file browser (HECHO).** A full-screen file tree for the active
  thread's `cwd`, reachable from a new `folder_open` `IconSurface` in the
  conversation top bar (next to the existing git action). Lists every file and
  folder, including hidden dotfiles, with the git-aware color treatment the
  user asked for: tracked-but-unchanged files are neutral; `added`,
  `modified`, `deleted`, `renamed` and `untracked` each get a distinct color
  (matching the `GitScreen` + `GitDiffView` chrome). Tapping a directory
  toggles its expansion (lazy `workspace/list` walks); tapping a file opens
  the new **file viewer**. New `FileBrowserManager`
  (`application/managers/`) + per-cwd stream provider; entity layer in
  `domain/entities/file_browser.dart`. i18n strings added in EN + ES.

- **File viewer (HECHO).** A second screen, pushed from the browser, that
  decides the rendering by extension:
  - **Images** (`.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg`/`.gif`/`.webp`/`.bmp`): inline
    `Image.memory` from `workspace/readImage`'s base64, wrapped in an
    `InteractiveViewer` for pinch-zoom and pan.
  - **Markdown** (`.md`/`.markdown`): a **preview** (rich
    `flutter_markdown` rendering with M3 chrome — code blocks, blockquotes,
    …) **or the raw source** (preserving indent / escape sequences), toggled
    by a top-bar action; the choice is a per-session toggle. The footer pill
    surfaces the current mode.
  - **Code / text**: syntax highlighting via `flutter_highlight` with the
    `atom-one-{dark,light}` themes (matching the message-content renderer);
    per-extension language detection (Dart/TypeScript/JavaScript/Python/Swift/
    Kotlin/Java/Go/Rust/C/C++/CSS/SCSS/HTML/JSON/YAML/TOML/XML/Bash/SQL/Markdown).
  - **Git diff overlay**: for files that report a `git status`, the viewer
    fetches `git/diff { path }` and renders the unified diff with the same
    +/- coloring as `GitDiffView` in the conversation; a top-bar toggle
    switches back to the raw file content. The footer status pill paints the
    file's git state (added/modified/deleted/renamed/untracked).
  - **Binary placeholder**: a graceful "binary file" message when the
    bridge returned base64 instead of UTF-8.
  - **Copy file** action: copies the current content (or base64) to the
    clipboard, with a snackbar.
  The viewer's chrome mirrors the browser (transparent `NeTopBar` +
    scroll-veil body) and reuses the `IconSurface` / `IconSurfaceMenu`
    components for a consistent Neural Expressive feel.
### Added
- **Seq-based catch-up on reconnect (mobile half)** — the phone now persists the
  highest bridge→phone `seq` it has applied per device and advertises it on
  reconnect so the bridge replays only the outbound it missed (spec 02a §5.9.2).
  `ClientHello` gained a `resumeState` field
  (`{ lastAppliedBridgeOutboundSeq }`, omitted when 0) serialized into the
  handshake; `SecureTransportLayer.performHandshake` forwards it. The applied
  seq (tracked by `SecureChannel.decrypt` on `SecureSession.bridgeOutboundSeq`)
  is persisted on `TrustedDevice.lastAppliedBridgeOutboundSeq` — a new nullable
  drift column (schema **v5**, additive migration) read/written by
  `TrustedDeviceRepository`. `SessionCoordinator` loads it into the handshake and
  checkpoints it on every teardown (drop / disconnect / socket close) **and**
  periodically on the heartbeat, updating the in-memory active device
  synchronously so an immediate reconnect advertises the freshest value. With
  the bridge half already shipped, reconnects now resume the bridge→phone stream
  instead of silently dropping anything sent while the phone was briefly away.
  Covered by `handshake_messages_test.dart` (resumeState serialization),
  `trusted_device_repository_test.dart` (column round-trip + older-row default
  0), and `session_coordinator_test.dart` (persists on disconnect, advertises
  resumeState on reconnect, first connection sends none). Note: a bridge restart
  resets its in-memory outbound log, so a stale resume point yields no replay and
  the phone re-syncs via `turn/list` — acceptable and expected.
- **Approval decisions persist across scroll + restart** — the user's
  decision on every interactive approval card (Approve / Reject / "always
  allow this session") is now stored on-device via
  `ApprovalResponseStore` (`infrastructure/storage/approval_response_store.dart`,
  SharedPreferences) as soon as the card is tapped. The next time the same
  card scrolls into view — even after a full app restart — it renders its
  **resolved** state (`Decision recorded · Answered 14:32`) with no
  action buttons, so an answered prompt can never be re-answered. The
  resolved view also picks up a risk-tinted outline (success / warning /
  error / neutral) and a muted body text, so the "already decided" state
  reads at a glance in line with the Neural Expressive design language.
  Two new l10n strings: `approvalDecidedTitle` ("Decision recorded" /
  "Decisión registrada") and `approvalAnsweredAt` ("Answered" /
  "Respondido"). Covered by
  `test/unit/infrastructure/storage/approval_response_store_test.dart`
  (9 cases: round-trip, persistence across store instances, idempotency,
  forget, defensive decoding of corrupt/malformed blobs) and two new
  widget tests in `conversation_widgets_test.dart` that pre-seed the
  store and assert the action buttons are absent after hydration.

### Docs
- **Synced the spec (`architecture/00-index.md`,
  `architecture/02a-system-architecture.md`,
  `architecture/02b-contracts-and-requirements.md`) with the code.** This
  is a docs-only change in the mobile app; no runtime behavior changed.
  Per `AGENTS.md` → *Spec drift control (non-negotiable)*, every `DONE` in
  this monorepo's `FOR-DEV.md` is now reflected in the spec. The spec was
  behind the code (Neural Expressive, manual-code pairing bridge-first,
  voice, image attachments, per-model run-option knobs, context-usage
  indicator, per-agent `auth/status`, interactive approval, full Git,
  etc.). The spec now matches.
  - `architecture/00-index.md`: status table updated to the live
    Android-alpha-ready state (Neural Expressive added, the full repo
    set, manual-code pairing bridge-first, voice, stop-the-turn, attach,
    per-model run-option knobs, context-usage indicator, per-agent
    `auth/status`, interactive approval, per-PC threads with
    connection-targeted live actions, thread lifecycle actions, Remove
    device, full Git with per-file diff, push with deep-link +
    preferences + persistence). `architecture.old/` removed from the
    monorepo tree (archived in git tag `pre-architecture-old-archive`);
    relay marked as optional / self-hosted.
  - `architecture/02a-system-architecture.md`: section 2 (topologies
    re-ranked: LAN-direct and Tailscale-direct as primary/recommended;
    relay demoted to self-hosted fallback); section 3 (`IAgentAdapter`
    updated with the methods and capabilities that the app actually
    consumes today); section 5.5.3 (manual-code pairing reframed as
    bridge-first); section 5.5.4 (`PairingPayload` v2 with optional
    `relay` + `hosts`); section 5.10 (push split into bridge-direct
    primary + relay fallback).
  - `architecture/02b-contracts-and-requirements.md`: the canonical 59
    JSON-RPC methods + 8 streaming notifications the app consumes (or
    may consume) today + cross-cutting shapes (`PairingPayload` v2,
    `TurnSendParams`, `TurnAttachment`, `ApprovalResponse`, `AgentModel`,
    `AgentCapabilities`, `TurnUsage`).
- **Updated this monorepo's `README.md`** to reflect the Android
  alpha-ready state (status section, the full MVP, the iOS pending
  FOR-HUMAN list, the test count, the new i18n + Neural Expressive
  stack entries).

### Fixed
- **App-bar menu buttons ripple as circles, not squares.** The sort / more /
  pairing / conversation / git overflow menus wrapped a round surface in a
  `PopupMenuButton`, whose internal `InkWell` is rectangular — so the press
  ripple read as a square over the circle. New shared `IconSurfaceMenu` drives
  `showMenu` from a real `IconSurface`, so the ripple is clipped to the circle
  and the M3E press-scale spring plays, matching the standalone bar actions.
- **"Remove worktree" now appears** for worktree-backed threads: the app
  persists the `worktreePath` it created (the bridge doesn't track it), which is
  what gates the action.
- **Branch delete protects the primary branch** (`main`/`master`) and the
  current branch, and only offers deletion for local branches (never remotes).
- **Conversation auto-scroll reaches the true bottom.** It jumped to a stale
  `maxScrollExtent` (captured before streaming/late layout finished), landing
  just short and fighting a manual drag-down. It now jumps to the live bottom
  and re-checks next frame to catch late layout.

### Added
- **Git revert + branch/worktree deletion wiring.** `GitActionManager` gains
  `revert` (`git/revert`), `deleteBranch` (`git/deleteBranch`, `force`) and
  `removeWorktree` (`git/removeWorktree`, `force`) now that the bridge implements
  them. The git screen's overflow menu adds **"Revert last commit"** (creates a
  revert commit, preserving history — distinct from Undo commit). Branch-delete /
  worktree-management UI + cwd-vanished composer disable (`workspace/exists`) are
  follow-ups (see `FOR-DEV.md`).

### Fixed
- **Foreground push no longer fires for the conversation on screen.** The
  bridge-direct FCM push raised a foreground notification even while the user
  was viewing that conversation (the per-thread suppression only covered the
  local domain-event path). `PushNotificationService` now suppresses a
  foreground FCM whose `threadId` is the active conversation and — while
  connected — defers to the live WS/domain-event path so a push never
  duplicates the notification it already raises; a disconnected foreground (the
  devices list) still shows it. Covered by `foreground_push_suppression_test.dart`.

### Changed
- **Devices app-bar pairing entry is a floating menu** offering **Scan QR** or
  **Enter manual code**, instead of a single scan button. Uses the same
  `PopupMenuButton` + Icon-Surface style as the threads sort/more menus.

### Added
- **Manual-code pairing (`ManualCodeScreen`).** Pair without scanning a QR by
  typing the bridge **host** + the short **pairing code** shown on the PC. A new
  `ManualPairingService` (`infrastructure/pairing/`, dio) calls the bridge's
  `GET /pair/resolve?code=` directly, decodes the returned `PairingPayload`, and
  hands it to the normal `SessionCoordinator.processPairingPayload` handshake.
  Tolerant host parsing (`host` or `host:port`, default port 19850, scheme/path
  stripped) and classified errors (bad/expired code, rate-limited, unreachable,
  malformed). Reachable from the onboarding pair page ("Enter a code instead",
  route `/pairing/manual`). Covered by `manual_pairing_service_test.dart`.
  **UI pending the maintainer's on-device review** (AGENTS.md "UI changes").
  mDNS auto-discovery is a follow-up (`FOR-DEV.md`).
- **History windowing + conversation fork/resume.** The conversation timeline
  now renders only the most-recent page and offers a **"Show earlier messages"**
  header to load older history on demand (`ThreadManager.loadMoreHistory`),
  bounding widget build for long threads. A **"Fork conversation"** overflow
  action deep-copies the thread on the bridge (`thread/fork`) and opens the new
  one; opening a conversation now best-effort **resumes** it on the bridge
  (`thread/resume`, skipping archived threads). Incremental *remote* back-paging
  is a documented follow-up (the bridge's `turn/list` cursor is forward-only).
- **Image attachments in the composer (app side).** The "+" turn-tools sheet's
  Attach action (shown for `images`-capable agents) now picks an image from the
  **photo library** or **camera** (`image_picker`, downscaled to 2048 px / q85).
  Pending images appear as a removable thumbnail strip above the composer, an
  image-only message (empty text) can be sent, and sent/received images render
  inline. The image rides on `turn/send` as `attachments` and is echoed locally.
  **Dormant for delivery until the bridge accepts attachments** (no
  `TurnSendParams.attachments` / `AgentManager.sendTurn` forwarding yet) — the
  contract is documented in `FOR-DEV.md`.
- **Interactive approval prompts (app side).** The in-timeline approval card is
  now interactive: **Approve**, **Reject**, and **Always allow this session**,
  with a spring morph into a settled status row, an in-flight spinner, and
  re-enable on failure. `ThreadManager.respondApproval` sends the decision via
  `turn/send { approvalResponse: { approvalId, decision } }`; an in-memory
  `ApprovalResponses` provider tracks the per-request sending/resolved/failed
  state. **Dormant until the bridge supports approvals** — the Claude adapter
  runs headless and Echo doesn't emit requests, so this can't fire on-device
  yet; the exact bridge contract (emit + accept + route) is documented in
  `FOR-DEV.md`. Plan/subagent blocks were verified to be informational, not
  approval gates.
- **Extended git actions (branch & remote).** `GitActionManager` gains `pull`
  (`git/pull`), `checkout` (`git/checkout`), `createBranch` (`git/createBranch`)
  and `createWorktree` (`git/createWorktree`), surfaced in the git screen where
  each belongs rather than in a catch-all sheet:
  - **Pull** is a badged app-bar action that appears only when the branch is
    behind its remote (the badge counts the incoming commits).
  - **Switch branch** and **New branch** (create + checkout) live in the
    three-dots overflow menu.
  - The commit composer **morphs into a push control** once the working tree is
    clean and the branch is ahead — the commit button becomes a badged Push and
    the extra-options toggle becomes Undo-last-commit — so push and undo are no
    longer buried in the overflow menu.
  - **Worktree creation moved to the new-conversation dialog**: an optional "Run
    in a worktree" toggle creates an isolated branch checkout from the chosen
    working dir and starts the conversation in it. The phone derives a sibling
    path (the bridge needs an explicit path — no managed/auto-path yet); a "Let
    the bridge pick the location" switch forwards `managed` for the future.
  - Not wired yet, all blocked on missing bridge support (tracked in
    `FOR-DEV.md`): revert (`git/revert`), safe branch/worktree **deletion**
    (`git/deleteBranch` / `git/removeWorktree`), and detecting a vanished
    cwd/worktree to disable the threads that lived in it.
- **Branding footer on the devices list.** The home screen now shows a small
  footer at the bottom: the localized app name ("Uxnan Mobile" / "Uxnan
  Móvil") and an "ALPHA" release-stage pill. The footer uses
  `SliverFillRemaining(hasScrollBody: false)` so it pins to the bottom of
  the screen with few paired PCs, and shrinks to its natural size right
  after the last card when the list is long — it never leaves a
  screen-sized white gap when you scroll. The pill is a neutral,
  non-interactive label (modeled on the existing `_RiskBadge` /
  `_TokenChip` pattern) so the alpha status is always visible without
  standing out across theme changes.
- **"Scroll to latest on send" setting** (Settings → Conversation, on by
  default). When you send a message the conversation jumps to your message even
  if you'd scrolled up; turn it off to keep your manual scroll position on send.
  (Auto-scroll still follows the stream while you're near the bottom.)

### Changed
- **Neural Expressive UI redesign — pilot: the conversation screen.** Reworked
  the conversation surface to the Material 3 Expressive / Neural Expressive
  design language (see `docs/neural-expressive-design.md`), cutting the visual
  noise the old layout accumulated **while preserving every function**:
  - The large two-line app bar is gone. A lean **56 dp transparent top bar with
    a scroll veil** carries only the **model-picker pill**, the git action and
    the overflow menu — each on the neutral circular **Icon Surface** tone (the
    overflow menu now matches the git action; the connection dot was dropped, as
    earlier screens already show online state).
  - **Context usage and the turn's numeric diff moved out of the chrome** to a
    compact, right-aligned info row just above the composer: `+a −d` (numbers
    only — the Git screen has the detail) next to the context indicator, both on
    the same neutral surface as the Icon Surfaces.
  - The composer is now a **fully-rounded floating pill** (matching the model
    pill and Icon Surfaces) with only the essentials: a "+", the text field, and
    a mic that swaps to Send (and to Stop while a turn runs). Its controls share
    one vertical baseline; it stays editable while offline (draft now, send when
    reconnected) — only *sending* is gated.
  - The "+" opens a unified **turn-tools sheet** (attach + run-option knobs +
    approval mode), replacing the always-on options strip above the composer.
  - Agent activity now reads as a **morphing polygon loader** at the *start of
    each streaming response* (not a bar across the top).
  - **Floating menus are rounded and roomier** (16 dp corners, min width) — the
    overflow menu and the run-option knob menus, plus 28 dp bottom-sheet corners.
  - The **work log** and the **reasoning ("Thinking")** section share one light
    **borderless** container (hairline outline, no fill). The work log shows its
    first few **commands inline (one truncated line each)**, in order, under the
    message that triggered them; its **header is always tappable** (even a single
    command expands to its full text + output), with a "+N" hint when collapsed.
    Thinking stays collapsed by default, gated to the Settings → Conversation
    toggle.
  - A matching **bottom scroll veil** sits above the composer (mirroring the top
    bar): the last messages fade into the surface as they reach it.
  - New shared building blocks for the rollout: spring-motion tokens
    (`theme/motion.dart`), `IconSurface`, `NeTopBar`, `PolygonLoader`, and the
    pill composer + turn-tools sheet.

  This is a UI proposal pending on-device review (per the propose → review →
  adjust → approve workflow). The remaining screens (devices, threads + the
  navigation drawer, git, settings) follow in later increments. The context
  meter moved out of the composer, so its two composer-level widget tests were
  retired; all other conversation tests still pass.

### Fixed
- **Streaming turns now truly interleave the work log with the response.** The
  live turn buffer preserves the order text and command/diff blocks arrive in,
  instead of accumulating all text in one string and all blocks in another and
  rendering every command above the answer. The activity now sits under the
  message that triggered it, in execution order. Persisted turns keep that order
  across a `turn/list` re-sync (the split text runs reconcile to the same full
  answer); a turn loaded purely from history can't interleave yet — the wire
  `blocks` array carries no per-block text offset (tracked as `FOR-DEV` in
  `thread_manager`).
- **Agent responses no longer collapse into one block.** An assistant turn now
  renders its work logs and responses **in chronological order** (a work log
  sits just above the response it precedes) instead of stacking every work log
  on top of one merged prose block — interleaved responses read as separate
  paragraphs again. Thinking stays at the top; the Changed files summary at the
  end. (No functionality lost.)
- **Context meter persists when you re-open a chat** — the bridge now stores a
  turn's token usage and returns it in history, and the phone restores the meter
  on re-sync, so it no longer resets to 0 on leaving and returning to the same
  conversation.

### Added

- **Stop the agent mid-turn.** While the agent is producing a turn, the composer
  Send button becomes a red **Stop** button that cancels the in-flight turn
  (`turn/cancel`, via `ThreadManager.cancelTurn`) without closing the thread — so
  a message sent by mistake can be stopped and rewritten.
- **Copy your own message.** Tapping a user (right-side) bubble toggles a **Copy
  message** action beneath it (hidden by default), mirroring the agent turn's
  copy action. The user bubble's text is no longer selectable (the tap toggles
  the copy affordance instead of placing a cursor).
- **Work log / Changed files / thinking now also populate for Codex, pi and
  OpenCode** (the phone already decodes the structured events; the bridge now
  emits them for every agent — see `bridge/CHANGELOG.md`). Pending on-device
  verification of each CLI's tool shapes.

### Changed

- **Conversation centers within a max width on wide screens (tablets).** The
  message list, the above-composer chrome (login banner, run-options strip,
  "Last edits" strip) and the composer content are now constrained to
  `UxnanSpacing.maxContentWidth` and centered, so extra horizontal space becomes
  side margins instead of over-wide messages and a composer whose right-hand
  controls floated far from the edge. The app bar and the composer's surface
  still span the full width.

### Fixed

- **Part of an agent reply no longer disappears after leaving and re-opening a
  conversation.** Fixed in the bridge (it was storing only the final segment of a
  tool-using turn); see `bridge/CHANGELOG.md`. The phone already kept the full
  streamed text live.
- **Context meter no longer stuck at 0** for turns where the agent's `result`
  event omitted token usage (bridge fallback to per-message usage).

### Added

- **Work log & Changed files now populate (structured commands/tools/diffs).**
  The bridge emits the agent's shell commands, file edits and tool calls as
  structured `stream/content/block` events; the phone decodes each into a
  `MessageContent` (`ContentBlockEvent` → timeline reducer) and folds it into the
  turn, so the collapsible **Work log** (Bash → command cards, other tools →
  rows) and **Changed files** (Edit/Write → per-file diffs with +/- counts) — and
  the green/red **Last edits** strip above the composer — finally fill in. Blocks
  stream live and are persisted (survive `turn/list`). Claude Code today; Codex/pi
  next.
- **Agent "thinking" (reasoning) in conversations — first structured-content
  slice.** Claude Code's extended-thinking output now flows end-to-end: the
  bridge parses `thinking_delta` blocks and emits a new `stream/thinking/delta`
  event (persisted on the message), and the phone renders it in a **collapsible
  "Thinking" section** at the top of the agent's turn (`ThinkingContent` block,
  default collapsed). A **Settings → Conversation → "Show agent thinking"**
  toggle (persisted) controls whether it appears. Thinking is kept out of the
  copied response / previews. (Commands, tools and diffs are the next slices —
  they still arrive as text until the bridge emits structured blocks for them.)
- **Workspace browser: "up one folder" button.** The folder-picker sheet now has
  an explicit up-one-level button to the left of the breadcrumb (disabled at a
  root); the breadcrumb still navigates on tap.
- **Voice → text in the composer.** The composer mic now dictates into the
  message field via on-device speech-to-text (`speech_to_text`): tap to start,
  tap again (or a final result) to stop, with recognized words streaming in
  live and a recording state on the mic chip. A guarded `SpeechToTextService`
  (+ `speechToTextServiceProvider`) no-ops without the plugin / mic permission,
  so the app and tests run unaffected; an "unavailable" snackbar covers the
  denied/unsupported case. Android `RECORD_AUDIO` is wired; iOS Info.plist
  usage strings are FOR-HUMAN. On-device verification is deferred (needs a mic).
- **Structured agent turns in the conversation (work log, changed files,
  copy).** An assistant reply now renders as a structured, full-width turn
  (`AssistantTurnView`): a collapsible **Work log (N)** of the commands/tools it
  ran, the prose answer, a collapsible **Changed files (N) · +a −d** summary at
  the end (each file expands to its diff), and a **Copy response** action that
  copies the full text. A compact green/red **Last edits** strip above the
  composer mirrors the latest turn's `+a −d · N files`. Diff +/- counters are now
  colored (green additions / red deletions) everywhere.
- **Settings screen + notification preferences (`notifications/update`).** A new
  `SettingsScreen` (route `/settings`, reached via a gear action in the devices
  app bar) lets the user toggle the **Replies** (`turnCompleted`) and **Errors**
  (`turnError`) notification channels with M3 `SwitchListTile`s. A
  `NotificationPreferences` value object, an on-device `NotificationPreferencesStore`
  (`shared_preferences`) and `notificationPreferencesProvider` are now the source
  of truth: the `PushRegistrar` sends them as `preferences` on
  `notifications/register` and gates the local notifications it raises, replacing
  the hard-coded `{turnCompleted:true, turnError:true}`. Toggling persists locally
  and best-effort calls `notifications/update` while a PC is connected (a silent
  no-op offline / against an older bridge). Covered by unit + widget tests.
- **pi agent support.** The `pi` CLI is now a fully wired agent on the bridge,
  so it appears in the app like the others through the existing data-driven UI
  (model picker, reasoning-effort knob via `--thinking`, context meter, sign-in
  status). Added its monochrome logo (`assets/images/agents/pi.svg`, tinted via
  `currentColor`) and wired `AgentVisuals` (logo/label "pi"/accent). No UI code
  changes were needed — the app already renders any agent the bridge advertises.

### Changed

- **Agent replies no longer sit in a chat bubble.** Only the user's own
  messages keep a (right-aligned) bubble; assistant turns render full-width, so
  the whole answer is one clean selectable surface and consecutive text is merged
  into a single selectable region instead of many fragments that copied as if
  they were separate messages.
- **Model picker grouped by provider + no inline-dropdown jank.** The model
  picker (`model_picker_sheet.dart`) now groups models under provider headers
  (M3 list subheaders) for multi-provider agents like pi/OpenCode, flattened
  into one lazy `ListView.builder` so hundreds of models stay cheap; agents with
  a single provider (Claude/Codex) render flat without headers. Grouping is a
  pure domain helper (`groupModelsByProvider` in `agent_model.dart`, unit-tested).
  The new-conversation dialog's model field no longer builds a giant inline
  `DropdownMenu` (which stalled for pi's ~326 models) — it's a tappable field
  that opens the same sheet, showing the selected model and a spinner while the
  list loads.
- **Conversation app bar scrolls away for more reading room.** The large app
  bar drops `snap` (keeps `floating`, stays non-pinned), so it scrolls fully out
  of the way with the content and returns proportionally on scroll-up instead of
  snapping the tall header open — more clean space for messages.
- **Consistent `.large` app-bar title height across screens.** The conversation
  app bar used a two-line `Column` title (title + connection/"Responding…"
  status), which sat at a different level/size than the single-line titles on
  the devices, threads and archived screens. Its title is now a single-line
  `Text` like the others, and the live connection / responding state moved to a
  compact dot/spinner indicator in the actions (tooltip carries the label) — so
  all four `.large` bars align at the same title level and size.
- **Conversation options strip: coherent spacing + collapsible.** The reasoning
  (run-option) and approval-mode controls are now one strip above the composer
  with consistent vertical rhythm (fixes the run-option chip sitting flush
  against the composer for pi, and the over-large gap when both showed). A
  `tune` toggle in the composer toolbar collapses/expands the strip
  (`AnimatedSize`), shown only when there's something to toggle.
- **Manual "Check sign-in" on the not-signed-in surfaces.** Both the
  new-conversation agent card and the **conversation login banner** now offer a
  **Check sign-in** `TextButton` that re-queries `auth/status` on tap (spinner
  while checking), so the user can verify sign-in without leaving the screen —
  complementing the on-resume refresh. The card also gains a soft error tint
  (replacing its static "Sign in required" text); the banner keeps its
  error-container strip (the M3 alert-with-action shape — not a `MaterialBanner`,
  which is a top-of-content component) and adds the action at the end. Both
  reuse `authStatusProvider` + `ref.invalidate` and un-resolve once signed in.

### Fixed

- **Agent sign-in status refreshes after a PC-side login.** `auth/status` is
  cached per agent and the PC's sign-in state can change with no phone-side
  reconnect, so a re-login on the PC left the app showing the agent as "not
  signed in". The app now re-queries `auth/status` on **app resume** (a new
  `authStatusRefreshProvider` tick that `authStatusProvider` watches; `_PushHost`
  bumps it on `AppLifecycleState.resumed`), clearing the stale banner / red dot.

### Added

- **Context meter always visible for usage-reporting agents.** The composer's
  context meter now shows for any agent that reports token/context usage (new
  per-agent `reportsContextUsage` capability — Claude/Codex true, OpenCode
  false), at a **0 baseline** until the first turn reports usage (then the
  percentage ring once the window is known, or the raw token count). Agents that
  report no usage show nothing, as before.
- **Data-driven run-option knobs.** The conversation screen now renders the
  per-model run options the bridge advertises on `agent/models` (today a
  **Reasoning effort** enum on Claude/Codex models) as a generic control bar
  above the composer, and sends the chosen values on `turn/send` via `options`
  (persisted per thread, in memory). The renderer is fully data-driven —
  `AgentModelOption`/`AgentModelOptionValue` entities, an `activeModelOptions`
  provider that resolves the thread's model, and a `runOptionSelections`
  notifier — so a new knob (or a new agent) needs **no app change**; `enum`
  renders as a value menu, `toggle` as a filter chip, and unknown kinds are
  ignored. Phase 3 of the per-model run-options seam.
- **Relay-vs-direct transport indicator.** The connected PC's card now shows how
  the live channel runs — **Relay** or **Direct** (LAN/Tailscale) — read from
  the bridge's `bridge/status.relayConnected`, which the app previously ignored
  (it used `bridge/status` only as a reachability ping). New `BridgeStatus`
  entity (tolerant parser) and a `bridgeStatusProvider` that refreshes whenever
  the connected device changes and short-circuits to nothing while offline.
- **Remove device.** The paired-PC card's overflow menu now has a destructive
  **Remove device** action: after a confirmation dialog it tells the bridge to
  revoke this phone's trust (`bridge/removeTrustedDevice` with the phone's own
  id, best-effort and only when connected to that PC), tears down the session if
  it was the connected one, and wipes the PC's local data — the `TrustedDevice`
  plus all its threads, messages and turns (new
  `IThreadRepository.deleteThreadsByDeviceId` and
  `SessionCoordinator.removeTrustedDevice`). Lets the user clear a stale PC and
  fully unpair. Menu labels are now `Flexible` so long entries never overflow.
- **Agent sign-in banner (`auth/status`).** The conversation screen now queries
  the bridge's sanitized per-agent `auth/status` for the active thread's agent
  and shows a warning banner above the composer when that agent is **not signed
  in on the PC** (turns won't run until the user logs into its CLI there). New
  `AuthStatus` entity (tolerant parser, never carries tokens),
  `ThreadManager.loadAuthStatus(agentId)` and an `authStatusProvider`
  `FutureProvider.family`, mirroring the existing `agentModels`/
  `agentCapabilities` providers. The banner is gated on actually holding this
  thread's PC channel (`connectedHere`) and degrades to nothing while offline or
  against an older bridge. Informational only for now — there is no in-app login
  yet (the bridge's `auth/login` is still a stub), so it points the user to the
  PC; it also renders a "Signing in…" state for `loginInProgress`.
- **Sign-in status before entering a conversation.** The agent's sign-in state
  (`auth/status`) is now surfaced earlier, reusing `authStatusProvider`: the
  **new-conversation** agent card shows a red "Sign in required" marker when the
  agent is installed but not signed in (distinct from "Unavailable" — the card
  stays selectable), and a thread's **status dot in the list turns red** (with a
  tooltip) when its agent is not signed in, instead of the usual active green.
  Both degrade to no marker while offline or against an older bridge.

### Fixed

- **Crash when leaving a conversation (`Tried to modify a provider while the
  widget tree was building`).** The conversation screen cleared the foreground
  marker by mutating `foregroundThreadProvider` synchronously in `dispose()`,
  which Riverpod rejects during unmount. It now defers the clear to the next
  event-loop tick (`leave()` stays a no-op if another thread is already in
  front), so back-navigation no longer throws.
- **Notifications wrongly suppressed on the threads list.** The "currently
  viewing" thread was cleared inside `dispose()` via `ref`, which is unreliable
  in Riverpod — the clear could be dropped, leaving the last-opened thread
  marked as foreground and suppressing its notifications even after leaving the
  conversation. The conversation screen now captures the notifier in `initState`
  and clears on leave, so suppression applies only while its conversation is on
  screen.

### Added

- **Unread thread indicator.** When an agent reply lands in a thread you're not
  viewing, its row in the threads list is emphasized — a primary-tinted surface,
  a **bold title** and a small **unread dot** — so it's easy to spot without
  tapping the notification. Cleared when you open (or return to) the
  conversation. In memory only (resets on restart). `ThreadManager` tracks the
  unread set, gated by the foreground thread.

### Changed

- **Personalized turn notifications.** A turn-end local notification is now
  titled with the **thread name** and its body reads **"{agent} replied"** /
  **"{agent} reported an error"** (e.g. *"Cambio de rutina" — "Opencode te
  respondió"*) — was a generic "Turn completed / Your agent finished a turn."
  The agent label + thread title are resolved per event; copy is parameterized
  in l10n.

### Added

- **Threads list: search, sort and density controls (active + archived).**
  Shared `thread_list_controls.dart` so both lists behave identically:
  - **Search** — the M3 full-screen `SearchAnchor` view, matching by title, id,
    agent (label or wire id) and working folder; tapping a result opens it.
  - **Sort** — an M3 menu (check on the active order): creation date (newest
    first, the **new default**), name, or folder. The per-agent filter chips are
    unchanged.
  - **Density** — a compact, single-line tile variant (the full tile stays the
    default).
  - App-bar kept to the M3 ≤3-actions guideline: **Search + Sort** stay visible;
    **Density** (checkable) and **Archived** (navigation) live in a `⋮` overflow
    menu. The archived screen gained the same search/sort/density controls.
  - Preferences are in-memory per screen (not yet persisted).

- **"Responding…" header in the conversation.** While the agent is producing a
  turn, the conversation app-bar shows a small spinner + "Responding…" (primary
  colour) in place of the connection label, so a reply is clearly on the way
  even before the first streamed delta. Driven by the per-thread activity that
  already powers the threads list.

### Fixed

- **No redundant local notification for the conversation you're watching.** A
  turn-end (completed/error) local notification is now **suppressed while that
  thread's conversation is on screen in the foreground** — you already see the
  reply live. It still fires for a turn that ends in a *different* thread, and
  while the app is backgrounded (you're no longer watching). Wired via a new
  `foregroundThreadProvider` the conversation screen sets on enter and clears on
  leave / app-background; `PushRegistrar` reads it before raising the notice.

- **Thread `createdAt`/last-activity now parsed from the bridge.** The parser
  read `json['lastActivity']`, a field the wire never carries, so a thread's
  last-activity time was always null (blank in the list). It now maps the
  bridge's `updatedAt` to last-activity and keeps `createdAt` — exposed on the
  `Thread` entity and persisted by the drift repo (which previously stamped
  `now()` on every save, clobbering the real creation time). Enables a stable
  "newest first" ordering.

- **No more phantom threads or silent send failures** (chat was broken: messages
  sent, no responses). `ThreadManager.startThread` fabricated a local `uuid`
  thread whenever `thread/start` returned an error or no result — so the bridge
  never had that thread and every `turn/send` failed with `-32008 thread not
  found`, silently. It now surfaces the error (the new-conversation flow reports
  it) instead of inventing an id, and `sendUserMessage` marks the user's message
  **failed** when the bridge rejects the turn, so a failure is visible rather
  than swallowed. (Pairs with the bridge `thread/start` browsed-cwd fix.)

### Changed

- **Conversation composer + app bar aligned to Material 3.** The composer was a
  floating rounded card (`elevation`/shadow + `circular(24)`) — replaced with a
  **bottom-anchored bar** on `surfaceContainer` with a top `outlineVariant`
  hairline (no card, no shadow), so it reads as screen chrome and lets the
  thread breathe (the M3 surface-tone pattern over a custom floating surface).
  The app-bar git affordance dropped the redundant branch `ActionChip` (chips
  aren't an app-bar action widget) for a single `IconButton` with a commit icon
  that opens the git sheet; the branch now shows in its tooltip.

- **Drop the unused `RELAY_URL` compile-time define.** The bridge address comes
  entirely from the pairing QR (`PairingPayload` `hosts`/`relay`, persisted on
  the `TrustedDevice`), so the `AppConstants.relayUrl` `--dart-define` was dead
  (never read). Removed the constant and the `--dart-define=RELAY_URL=…` from the
  README run command + build-flavors table, with a note that a fresh bridge is
  LAN/Tailscale-direct (relay optional, only for background push).

- **New-conversation flow redesigned (Material 3).** It is now a **full-screen
  M3 dialog** (roomier than a bottom sheet for a multi-input creation task)
  with: a **working-directory card** that defaults to the bridge's root and a
  "Browse…" action to pick any sub-folder (the manual project list is gone — the
  bridge auto-roots at its launch dir), **agent cards** that clearly show each
  agent's logo, name and **capability chips** (Streaming / Plan / Approvals /
  Forking / Images) with a selected state, and the model field. The built-in
  **Echo (dev) agent is hidden** from the picker.

### Added

- **Android push notifications activated (Firebase project `uxnan-app`).** The
  `com.uxnan.mobile` Android app is registered in Firebase, `google-services.json`
  is provisioned (gitignored), and the **Google Services Gradle plugin is wired
  conditionally** — `settings.gradle.kts` keeps it on the classpath (`apply
  false`) and `app/build.gradle.kts` applies it only `if
  (file("google-services.json").exists())`, so the build stays green without the
  config. iOS is registered in the same project (`GoogleService-Info.plist`
  placed) but push remains **pending** the APNs key (macOS + Apple Developer);
  see `FOR-HUMAN.md`.

- **Folder browser for new conversations (`workspace/browseDirs`)** — a
  plug-and-play way to root a thread anywhere under the bridge's configured
  browse roots, alongside the configured project list. New `BrowseRoot` /
  `BrowseDirEntry` / `BrowseResult` entities (tolerant parsers), a
  `WorkspaceBrowser` manager + provider, and a `WorkspaceBrowserSheet` (root
  picker, breadcrumb, git-repo badges, "Open here"). The new-conversation sheet
  gains a **"Browse…"** action: the chosen folder is resolved to a project
  (`project/resolve`) and started via `thread/start { cwd }`.

### Fixed

- **Everything now targets the PC we are actually connected to.** Browsing a
  paired PC's threads no longer implies a connection: the threads-screen online
  dot, the new-conversation FAB, and refresh are gated on holding *that* PC's
  live channel (`connectedDeviceProvider`), not the global phase — and an
  offline banner offers a validated "Connect" here. The conversation composer is
  disabled unless connected to the thread's PC, so messages can never be sent
  over a different connected PC's channel. Tapping a PC to browse no longer
  changes the connection/reconnect target (`setActiveDevice` removed from the
  browse path).
- **Codex context usage is now visible in the composer** — the context chip
  showed only Claude's percentage; it now also renders the raw token count when
  the model's window is unknown (Codex).

- **Context-usage indicator** — consumes the new `turn/completed` `usage`:
  `ThreadManager` tracks per-thread token usage (`contextUsageProvider`) and the
  session environment shows a **percentage** when the model's context window is
  known (Claude tiers) or the **raw token count** otherwise (Codex), replacing
  the FOR-DEV placeholder in the status sheet. OpenCode reports no usage.
- **Live conversations survive leaving the screen + per-thread activity** — the
  `ThreadManager` now buffers each thread's in-flight turn in memory (it is a
  singleton) and applies streaming events for **all** threads, not just the one
  on screen. Leaving and re-entering a conversation keeps the streaming response
  rendering and updating; an answer that completes off-screen is persisted
  (keyed by the deterministic `stream-<turnId>` id) and shown on return.
  Entering a thread also re-syncs it from the bridge (`turn/list`) to recover
  anything missed (e.g. after an app restart). A new `ThreadActivity`
  (`running`/`error`/idle) is exposed per thread and the list card shows a
  **"Responding…" spinner** while a conversation is working — replacing the
  unclear static dot for active turns (`threadActivityProvider`).

### Fixed

- **Switching PCs no longer fakes the connection status** — tapping a paired PC
  to browse its threads previously flipped it to "connected" (and the current PC
  to "disconnected") because the indicator keyed off the *selected* device plus
  the stale global phase. Status now follows the device that actually holds the
  live channel (`connectedDeviceProvider`) and the one being attempted
  (`connectingDeviceProvider`). The **Connect** action validates reachability
  first (`SessionCoordinator.switchMac` probes then commits): if the target is
  unreachable it stays on the current PC and surfaces a message, instead of
  optimistically switching. Browsing a PC never implies a connection.

### Added

- **Structured model picker + resolved-version display** — consumes the
  bridge's richer `agent/models` contract so model selection is plug-and-play
  across Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode:
  - New `AgentModel` entity (`domain/entities/agent_model.dart`) parsing the
    structured contract (`id`, `displayName`, `description?`, `version?`,
    `isDefault?`) and tolerating bare-string responses from older bridges.
    `ThreadManager.loadModels` / `agentModelsProvider` now return
    `List<AgentModel>`.
  - The model picker and the new-conversation model field show readable names,
    a "Default" badge, and a secondary line with the wire id / resolved version
    / description; selection still routes by `id`.
  - **Resolved-version surfacing**: a new `stream/model/resolved`
    (`ModelResolvedEvent`) updates an in-memory `resolvedModelsProvider`; the
    session status sheet shows the concrete version an alias resolved to (e.g.
    `opus` → `claude-opus-4-8`) under a new "Active version" row.

### Added

- **Direct LAN/Tailscale transport (relay now optional)** — consumes the
  bridge's pairing-QR `hosts` so the phone connects directly, with the relay as
  a fallback (spec 02a §5.9.3; bridge `docs/connectivity.md`):
  - `PairingPayload` now parses `hosts: List<String>` and treats `relay` as
    optional (a pure LAN/Tailscale QR carries only `hosts`); the structural
    parser is tolerant and `PairingValidator` enforces "at least one transport"
    — mirroring `shared` `validatePairingPayload`. **Fixes** the old parser,
    which threw on a relay-less QR.
  - `TrustedDevice` carries `hosts`, persisted by `TrustedDeviceRepository`
    (drift schema → v4: additive, nullable `trusted_devices.hosts` column,
    newline-separated; relay-only devices load with empty hosts).
  - `DirectTransportSelector` (now the default `transportSelectorProvider`)
    tries each direct host as a plain `ws://host:port` endpoint (the bridge's
    LAN server needs no relay routing headers) with a short per-host timeout,
    then falls back to the relay with the `x-role`/`x-session-id` headers.
    `processPairingPayload` carries the scanned `hosts` onto the device.
  - UI (proposal, pending on-device review): the `MyDevicesScreen` card shows
    the first direct host when a device has no relay (instead of a blank).
  - Tests: payload hosts parse + relay-optional, validator transport rule,
    repository hosts round-trip, and `DirectTransportSelector` (direct-first,
    host→host→relay fallback, per-host timeout, no-transport error, scheme
    passthrough).

- **Archive / unarchive threads + an "Archived" screen** — completes the
  thread-actions set (rename/delete already shipped):
  - `ThreadManager.archiveThread` / `unarchiveThread` flip the local
    `ThreadStatus` first (archived threads leave the active list immediately),
    then call `thread/archive` / `thread/unarchive` best-effort — **nothing is
    deleted**; degrades gracefully if the bridge lacks the method.
  - UI (proposal, pending on-device review): the long-press menu gains
    **Archive** (active threads) / **Unarchive** (archived threads); the
    `ThreadsScreen` hides archived threads and gets an **Archived** app-bar
    action → a new per-PC `ArchivedThreadsScreen` (route
    `/device/:deviceId/archived`) where archived threads can be reopened,
    unarchived or deleted. The thread row + actions menu were extracted to a
    shared `ThreadTile` (`thread_tile.dart`) reused by both screens. New en/es
    strings. Archived threads are **per-PC** (not in the future app Settings).

- **Advanced message content: `approval` / `plan` / `subagent`** — these blocks
  used to fall through to the generic `UnknownContent` placeholder; they now
  decode and render properly (exactly what Codex/Claude emit for plan mode &
  approvals):
  - Domain: `ApprovalContent`/`PlanContent`/`SubagentContent` + value objects
    `ApprovalRequest`, `PlanState`/`PlanStep`, `SubagentState`/`SubagentAction`
    and enums `ApprovalRisk`, `PlanStepStatus`, `SubagentActionKind`. The codec
    is tolerant of both nested (`{request|state:{…}}`) and flat payloads and
    falls back gracefully on unknown enum values; JSON round-trips.
  - UI (proposal, pending on-device review): an approval card (action + risk
    badge + **disabled** Approve/Reject — FOR-DEV: the response RPC needs the
    bridge), a plan checklist (per-step status icons), and a subagent card
    (name/status + its actions). Read-only for now.

- **Capability-aware conversation UI** (proposal, pending on-device review) —
  the conversation now adapts to the active agent's advertised
  `AgentCapabilities` (from `agent/list`):
  - `agentCapabilitiesProvider` resolves a thread's agent capabilities, falling
    back to an all-permissive default (`AgentCapabilities.permissive()`) when the
    agent list isn't loaded yet, so controls are never hidden spuriously.
  - The `SessionStatusSheet` approval-mode row is shown only when the agent
    advertises `approvals`; the `ComposerBar` attach button only when it
    advertises `images` (the picker itself stays FOR-DEV). OpenCode (no
    approvals/images) hides both; Codex/Claude will surface them once the bridge
    exposes those agents. Verify on-device when they land.

- **New threads default their title to the thread id** — when a conversation is
  started without an explicit title, `ThreadManager.startThread` sets the local
  title to the new thread's own id (instead of a generic "New thread"), so it's
  identifiable in the list and resumable from the CLI on the PC. The user can
  rename it afterwards (see thread actions). An explicit title is preserved.

- **Thread management — rename, delete & copy id** — user-requested:
  - `ThreadManager.renameThread` mirrors the new title locally first (immediate
    UI), then calls `thread/rename { threadId, title }`; ignores a blank title.
  - `ThreadManager.deleteThread` removes the thread locally (clearing the active
    timeline when it was active), then calls `thread/delete { threadId }`.
  - Both are best-effort over the bridge and degrade gracefully when the method
    is not yet implemented (the local change is kept).
  - UI (proposal, pending on-device review): long-pressing a thread on
    `ThreadsScreen` opens an actions sheet (Rename / Copy thread ID / Delete)
    with a rename dialog and a delete confirmation. The conversation
    `SessionStatusSheet` gains a copyable **Thread ID** row (shortened display,
    copies the full id) so the same conversation can be resumed from the CLI on
    the PC. New en/es strings.

- **Notification tap → deep-link to the conversation** — closes the push loop:
  - `PushNotificationService` now exposes `onNotificationTap` (a `threadId`
    stream from foreground / background-resume taps) and `initialThreadId()`
    (the `threadId` that cold-started the app). Wires the local-notification
    `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse`, FCM `onMessageOpenedApp`, plus
    `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails()` / `getInitialMessage()` for cold start.
  - `PushRegistrar` re-exposes both; `_PushHost` (`app.dart`) subscribes and
    deep-links taps to `/conversation/:threadId` (cold start navigates after the
    first frame). Fully guarded: a no-op when Firebase config is absent.

- **Per-thread model picker (`thread/setModel`)** — spec 02a §5.4:
  - `ThreadManager.setThreadModel` calls `thread/setModel { threadId, model }`
    and mirrors the new model onto the local `Thread`; `loadAgentModels`
    (`agent/models`) feeds the picker.
  - `ModelPickerSheet` (`conversation/support/model_picker_sheet.dart`): a
    searchable M3 bottom sheet that lists the agent's models and resolves with
    the pick. Wired into the composer model chip and the `SessionStatusSheet`
    model row (`ConversationScreen` → `setThreadModel`).
  - The real model picker is also used by `NewConversationSheet` (the agent's
    `defaultModel` preselected); onboarding is skipped when a PC is already
    paired (straight to the devices list).

- **"Verify connection" device action** — spec 02c §11:
  - `SessionCoordinator.verifyConnection` actively probes the bridge with an
    encrypted `bridge/status` (timeout), and reconnects first when the session is
    disconnected. Surfaced as a per-device action on `MyDevicesScreen`
    (`deviceVerifyConnection`, EN + ES).

### Changed

- **Threads scoped to the selected PC** — `Thread` now carries `deviceId`;
  `thread/list` results are tagged with the active device and the threads screen
  filters by it. Drift schema → v3: additive `threads.device_id` column + a
  migration that purges the old UI demo data (`demo-thread*`, `demo-mac`).

- **Robust reconnection + liveness** — spec 02c §11:
  - `turn/send` now sends `text` at the top level (was nested under `content`,
    which produced no response).
  - `WebSocketChannelTransport` sets a 20s `pingInterval` so a dead socket is
    detected; the relay closes the paired peer when one side drops (see
    `relay/CHANGELOG.md`).
  - `SessionCoordinator` runs a 25s `bridge/status` app heartbeat that detects a
    dead bridge behind a still-open relay socket and triggers reconnect; a
    single-flight reconnect guard prevents overlapping loops; `verifyConnection`
    reconnects when disconnected; last-seen is updated on connect.

### Fixed

- **Seq-replay race on outbound envelopes** — the secure transport reserves the
  outbound sequence number **synchronously** (before the `await` on encryption),
  and `SessionCoordinator` serializes encrypt+send onto a single `_sendChain`, so
  concurrent sends can no longer interleave and trip the bridge's replay
  rejection.
- **Model picker overflow + keyboard** — fixed the model-picker layout overflow
  and dismiss the keyboard when tapping the chat surface.

### Added

- **Push notifications (FCM) — gated** — spec 02a §5.10:
  - `PushNotificationService` (infrastructure): fully guarded `firebase_core` +
    `firebase_messaging` + `flutter_local_notifications`. The app builds and runs
    with **no** Firebase native config — `Firebase.initializeApp()` and every FCM
    call are try/caught; when config is absent `isAvailable` is `false` and push
    silently degrades to a no-op.
  - `PushRegistrar` (application): on `ConnectionPhase.connected` it fetches the
    FCM token and calls `notifications/register { pushToken, platform,
    preferences }` over the session RPC; re-registers on token refresh; raises a
    local notification on `TurnCompleted`/`TurnError` domain events.
  - `main.dart` guarded Firebase init + `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` background
    handler; `_PushHost` (under `MaterialApp.builder`) keeps the registrar alive
    and feeds it localized copy. EN + ES strings.
  - Android: core-library desugaring enabled (required by
    `flutter_local_notifications`). Native Firebase config is **FOR-HUMAN**
    (`FOR-HUMAN.md`): `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist` + the
    google-services gradle plugin + iOS push capability.
  - Tests: `PushRegistrar` (register-on-connect, no-reregister, token refresh,
    local notification on turn end) with a fake push service.

- **MVP wiring — real bridge data + new-conversation flow** — spec 02a §5.2 /
  §5.4 / §5.6:
  - `Thread` entity now carries `model` (alongside `agentId`/`cwd`), parsed from
    `thread/list` / `thread/start` and persisted (drift schema → v2, additive
    `threads.model` column + migration).
  - New bridge catalog entities `Project` (`project/list`) and `AgentDescriptor`
    + `AgentCapabilities` (`agent/list`) with tolerant parsers; `ThreadManager`
    gains `loadProjects`, `loadAgents` and `startThread` (`thread/start`).
    Providers: `projectsProvider`, `agentsProvider`, `threadByIdProvider`.
  - **New-conversation flow**: a "New conversation" / "Nueva conversación" FAB on
    the threads screen opens `NewConversationSheet` (M3 bottom sheet matching the
    existing `*_sheet.dart` patterns) to pick a project (name + cwd subtitle), an
    agent (only `available` ones selectable, capability hints, `AgentLogoChip`/
    `AgentVisuals` icon or a generic fallback) and an optional model (the agent's
    `defaultModel` preselected); `thread/start` then navigates to the
    conversation. FAB is disabled while disconnected.
  - **Conversation wired to real data**: the model/agent indicator is driven by
    the active `Thread`, connection state by `connectionPhaseProvider`, and the
    git branch/state by `gitRepoStateProvider` fed with the thread's `cwd`
    (refreshed via `GitActionManager.refreshStatus(cwd)`); `GitActionsSheet` runs
    real commit/push against that `cwd`. Removed `SessionEnvironment.sample()`,
    `GitRepoState.sample()` from the UI, and the `previewState` / `_simulatePush`
    FOR-DEV git paths.
  - **Composer/status controls**: the model indicator shows the real thread
    model; the context badge is hidden until the bridge reports real token usage
    (no fabricated 42%); approval mode is an explicit local per-thread setting
    (FOR-DEV note, no sampled value); attach/voice stay disabled placeholders
    (FOR-DEV).
  - **Removed demo seeding** from the default UX: deleted `demo_seed.dart` and
    the home preview button.
  - Tests: `Project`/`AgentDescriptor` parsers, `ThreadManager` `loadProjects`/
    `loadAgents`/`startThread`, the `model` thread round-trip, and updated
    composer/git-sheet widget tests to the real-data shape.

- **Conversation/timeline — application managers** — spec 02a §5.2.2 / §5.2.5:
  - `DomainEvent` hierarchy and `IncomingMessageProcessor` that classifies
    inbound bridge notifications (`stream/turn/started`, `stream/message/delta`,
    `stream/turn/completed`, `…/error`, `…/aborted`) into typed events; other
    `stream/*` notifications map to `UnknownDomainEvent`.
  - `ThreadManager`: builds the active thread's `TurnTimelineSnapshot` from the
    local message repository and applies streaming events through the reducer
    (start → delta → complete, persisting the finalized message); `loadThreads`
    (`thread/list`) and `sendUserMessage` (`turn/send`) over the injected RPC
    sender; dedup via `MessageDeduplicator`.
  - Providers: `incomingMessageProcessorProvider`, `threadManagerProvider`,
    `threadsProvider`, `activeTimelineProvider`.
  - Tests: event classification, and a `ThreadManager` driven by an in-memory
    DB + a controllable event stream (timeline build, full streaming turn,
    thread loading, send).
  - The conversation **UI** (`ConversationScreen`, renderers, composer) is the
    remaining piece (FOR-DEV), built next for visual review.

- **Conversation/timeline — domain & data layer** — spec 02a §5.6 / §6.2:
  - `MessageContent` sealed hierarchy with a JSON codec: `text`, `code`,
    `image`, `tool`, `diff`, `mermaid`, `system`, `command_execution`, plus an
    `UnknownContent` fallback so unmodeled/newer types round-trip losslessly.
  - `Message` and `Turn` entities; `MessageDeliveryState`, `SystemContentKind`
    and `CommandStatus` enums.
  - `IMessageRepository` + `DriftMessageRepository` (content stored as JSON in
    the existing `messages` table; ascending reads, limit + `beforeId`
    pagination, reactive `watch`). `messageRepositoryProvider` wired.
  - `MessageDeduplicator` (fingerprint/id dedup for replays, §5.6.5) and the
    immutable `TurnTimelineSnapshot` with a streaming reducer
    (reconcile / prependHistory / startStreaming / appendStreamingDelta /
    completeStreaming) per §5.4.6.
  - Tests: content codec round-trips + unknown fallback, repository
    CRUD/pagination/watch, deduplicator, and the timeline reducer.
  - Advanced content (`approval`/`plan`/`subagent`) and the application managers
    (`ThreadManager` timeline, `IncomingMessageProcessor`) + the conversation UI
    are deferred (FOR-DEV) to the next increments.

- **Pairing / onboarding UI** — spec 02a §5.5.1–5.5.2, M3 design tokens:
  - `OnboardingScreen`: a 4-page flow (Welcome → Features → Install bridge →
    Pair) with a page indicator, Skip/Back/Next controls and a copyable
    `CommandCardWidget` (`npx uxnan-bridge`); width-constrained for tablets.
  - Onboarding visual treatment: an `OnboardingBackground` (soft square grid +
    top-transparent → deeper-bottom gradient) and `FloatingAgents` — bundled
    coding-agent logos (`flutter_svg`, `assets/images/agents/`) that gently
    float on soft dark chips, with a different size/position preset per page.
    Implemented efficiently (one controller per page, GPU transforms,
    `RepaintBoundary`).
  - `QrScannerScreen`: camera permission gating (request / settings fallback),
    `mobile_scanner` preview with a scan window, validates the QR via
    `PairingValidator`, drives `SessionCoordinator.processPairingPayload`, and
    shows `UpdatePromptDialog` on an unsupported QR version.
  - Routes `/onboarding` and `/pairing`; the home "Pair a device" button now
    launches the flow. English + Spanish strings.
  - `mobile_scanner` and `permission_handler` dependencies; Android `CAMERA`
    permission and iOS `NSCameraUsageDescription` configured.
  - Widget test covering onboarding page navigation.
  - **FOR-DEV** (deferred): iOS `permission_handler` Podfile macro
    (`PERMISSION_CAMERA=1`), live on-device camera pairing against a real bridge.

- **Pairing logic (QR)** — spec 02a §5.5:
  - `PairingPayload` entity with `fromQrString` (Base64-JSON QR decode) and
    `PairingValidator` (domain service): checks QR version, required fields and
    expiry with clock-skew tolerance, returning a typed result.
  - `ITrustedDeviceRepository` + `TrustedDeviceRepository`: split storage —
    device metadata in drift, the bridge identity key in `SecureStore`.
  - `SessionCoordinator.processPairingPayload` (validate → persist
    `TrustedDevice` → set active → QR-bootstrap connect) and `cancelPairing`,
    with optional pairing dependencies so existing wiring is unaffected.
  - Providers: `trustedDeviceRepositoryProvider`, `pairingValidatorProvider`,
    wired into `sessionCoordinatorProvider`.
  - Tests: payload parse/round-trip + malformed/missing-field, validator
    (valid/expired/unsupported-version/malformed), repository split-storage
    round-trip, and an end-to-end `processPairingPayload` over the simulated
    bridge.
  - **FOR-DEV** (deferred): manual-code pairing (relay REST), the pairing/
    onboarding UI (next increment), and standalone pairing use-case classes.
    See `FOR-DEV.md`.

- **SessionCoordinator + connection orchestration** — spec 02a §5.2.1 / 02c §11:
  - `SessionCoordinator` (application layer): drives the connection lifecycle
    (connect / disconnect / switchMac), runs the handshake via
    `SecureTransportLayer`, opens a `SecureChannel`, and exposes
    `connectionPhase`, `recoveryState`, `activeMac` and inbound `incomingMessages`
    as streams.
  - `sendRequest`: encrypts + sends when connected, otherwise buffers for replay;
    inbound envelopes are decrypted and routed to the `RequestCorrelator`
    (responses) or the `incomingMessages` stream (requests/notifications).
  - Automatic reconnection: on an unexpected drop, retries with
    `BackoffCalculator` up to a max (default 10) before entering the terminal
    error phase; intentional `disconnect()` does not reconnect.
  - `TransportSelector` interface + `RelayTransportSelector` (relay via
    `relayUrl` with `x-role`/`x-session-id` headers; LAN discovery deferred).
  - `SecureStore` interface + `FlutterSecureStore`, and `PhoneIdentityStore`
    (load-or-create the persistent Ed25519 identity — spec 02b RF-PAIR-08).
  - Riverpod 3.x providers: `secureStoreProvider`, `phoneIdentityStoreProvider`,
    `secureTransportLayerProvider`, `transportSelectorProvider`,
    `sessionCoordinatorProvider`, and the `connectionPhaseProvider` /
    `connectionRecoveryProvider` / `activeMacProvider` `StreamProvider`s.
  - Tests: a persistent **simulated bridge over an in-memory transport** drives
    a full connect, an encrypted `sendRequest` round-trip, inbound notification
    delivery, intentional disconnect, and **automatic reconnect after a drop**;
    plus `PhoneIdentityStore` load-or-create against an in-memory store.
  - Deferred: `IncomingMessageProcessor` (domain-event classification, with the
    conversation module), `TransportSelector` LAN discovery, and live WebSocket
    integration against a real bridge.

- **Secure transport + connection mechanics** — spec 02a §5.9 / 02c §11:
  - `WebSocketTransport` interface + `WebSocketChannelTransport`
    (`web_socket_channel`, `IOWebSocketChannel` so the relay's `x-role` /
    `x-session-id` upgrade headers are honored).
  - `SecureTransportLayer.performHandshake`: the phone side of the
    clientHello → serverHello → clientAuth → ready flow, verifying the nonce
    echo, transcript expiry (with clock-skew tolerance), the trusted bridge
    identity, and the Ed25519 signature before deriving the session key.
  - `SecureChannel`: AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt with 1-based outbound
    sequencing and replay rejection (`seq <= lastApplied` ⇒
    `TransportException(replay)`).
  - `RequestCorrelator` (JSON-RPC request/response matching + timeout),
    `BackoffCalculator` (exp. 1→60s with ±30% jitter), `OutboundMessageBuffer`
    (sliding window) and `classifyRaw` message triage.
  - Value objects/entities: `RpcMessage` (+`RpcError`), `PhoneIdentity`,
    `TrustedDevice`, `ConnectionRecoveryState`; added `web_socket_channel` dep
    and a `TransportErrorKind.replay`.
  - Tests: a full **two-party handshake over an in-memory transport pair**
    (phone + simulated bridge derive the same key; untrusted-identity rejected),
    channel round-trip + replay rejection, correlator, backoff bounds, buffer
    sliding window, and RpcMessage JSON.
  - Deferred to the next increment: `SessionCoordinator` orchestration
    (ConnectionPhase state machine + reconnection loop + Riverpod wiring),
    `TransportSelector` LAN discovery, `IncomingMessageProcessor`, and live
    WebSocket integration against a real bridge.

- **E2EE cryptography** — spec 02a §5.9 / 02b §5:
  - `KeyGeneration`: Ed25519 identity key pairs, X25519 ephemeral key pairs,
    CSPRNG nonces.
  - `HandshakeCrypto`: canonical transcript builder, Ed25519 bilateral
    sign/verify, and X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 session-key derivation
    (`salt = clientNonce || serverNonce`, `info = "uxnan-e2ee-v1"`).
  - `EnvelopeCrypto`: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption with the documented
    envelope wire format (12-byte nonce, 16-byte tag); decryption failures
    surface as `TransportException(decryption)`.
  - `SecureSession` entity (in-memory key + seq counters) and `SecureEnvelope`
    value object.
  - `MessageFingerprinter` (SHA-256 via pointycastle) + `TextFingerprint`.
  - Tests against published vectors: Ed25519 (RFC 8032), X25519 (RFC 7748),
    HKDF-SHA256 (RFC 5869), AES-256-GCM (NIST all-zero), a full two-party
    handshake that proves both sides derive the same key, plus tamper/wrong-key
    rejection and SHA-256 known-answer checks.
  - Contract note: the transcript is the UTF-8 of the fields' wire strings
    concatenated in order (hex for byte fields, raw string for `sessionId`,
    decimal for integers); the bridge must mirror this exactly.
  - Library choice: AES-256-GCM uses the `cryptography` package (native
    acceleration via `cryptography_flutter`); the algorithm/params are exactly
    per spec — no variant. `pointycastle` remains for synchronous SHA-256.
  - Deferred to the connection module: WebSocket transport, secure-transport
    seq/replay enforcement, request correlator, LAN/relay transport selector,
    and the `SessionCoordinator` handshake orchestration (they need the live
    message flow / bridge).

- **Local persistence (drift / SQLite)** — spec 02c §10:
  - Full schema (`schemaVersion` 1): `threads`, `messages`, `turns`,
    `projects`, `trusted_devices`, `composer_drafts`, `git_action_log` tables,
    with WAL + foreign-keys pragmas.
  - `UxnanDatabase` (drift) with an in-memory `forTesting` constructor.
  - `Thread` domain entity + `IThreadRepository` / `IComposerDraftRepository`
    contracts.
  - `DriftThreadRepository` (faithful to spec §10.3) and
    `DriftComposerDraftRepository`.
  - DI providers: `databaseProvider`, `threadRepositoryProvider`,
    `composerDraftRepositoryProvider` (spec 03 §1.5 / §3.6 levels 1–2).
  - In-memory repository tests for the full thread CRUD + watch surface.
  - Table indexes use the real drift `@TableIndex` annotation (the spec's
    `List<Index> get indexes` sketch is not the actual drift API).
  - `Message`/`Turn`/`Project`/`TrustedDevice` repositories are deferred to
    their modules (they depend on the `MessageContent` sealed hierarchy,
    `AgentConfig`, or split storage with `SecureStore`); their tables already
    exist in the schema.

### Changed

- Migrated state management to **Riverpod 3.x** (`^3.0.0`), reconciling the
  spec's "Riverpod 3.x manual" guidance (AGENTS.md / 00-index). The state layer
  will use the modern `Notifier`/`NotifierProvider` API.
- Updated the Material 3 theme to provide both light and dark variants and
  follow `ThemeMode.system` instead of forcing dark mode. The shared design
  tokens now expose brightness-aware semantic colors, and existing screens were
  updated to consume theme-derived muted text colors.

### Added (foundation)

- Initial Flutter project scaffold (Android + iOS), package name `uxnan`,
  application id `com.uxnan.mobile`.
- Clean Architecture skeleton: `core/`, `domain/`, `application/`,
  `infrastructure/`, `presentation/` directory layers (per spec 02a §7).
- `core/` layer:
  - `protocol_constants.dart` and `app_constants.dart` (compile-time
    `--dart-define` configuration, spec 03 §3.3 / 02a §5.9.1).
  - Typed errors: `AppException`, `RpcException` (JSON-RPC code table),
    `TransportException`.
  - Extensions on `String`, `DateTime`, `Uint8List` (hex/base64).
  - `AppLogger` (gated by `ENABLE_LOGGING`) and `Debouncer` utilities.
- Domain enums: `MessageRole`, `TurnStatus`, `ThreadStatus`,
  `ThreadSyncState`, `HandshakeMode`, `ConnectionPhase`, `GitActionKind`,
  `AgentId` (with stable wire-id mapping).
- Material 3 design system: `colors.dart`, `typography.dart`, `spacing.dart`
  and the adaptive `buildUxnanTheme()` builder (spec 02c §3.1).
- App fonts bundled: Inter (400/500/600/700) and JetBrains Mono (400/500) under
  `assets/fonts/`, declared in `pubspec.yaml` (resolves the FOR-HUMAN item).
- App entry point: minimal `main.dart` (`ProviderScope`), `app.dart`
  (`MaterialApp.router` + theme + l10n), `app_router.dart` (`go_router`
  provider) and the home empty-state screen.
- Internationalization (`flutter_localizations` + ARB): English and Spanish.
- `analysis_options.yaml` based on `very_good_analysis` (spec 02c §15.1).
- Foundation tests: core extensions, `AgentId` mapping, and an app smoke test.
- iOS deployment target 15.0; Android `minSdk` 24 (spec 02b §3.4).

### Notes / deferred

- The following spec packages are added in their respective module increments
  to keep the build green until native configuration exists:
  Firebase (`firebase_core`, `firebase_messaging`, `flutter_local_notifications`),
  QR scanner (`mobile_scanner`, `permission_handler`), SSH terminal
  (`dartssh2`, `xterm`), rich media (`flutter_inappwebview`, `lottie`,
  `cached_network_image`, `shimmer`), `image_picker`, `file_picker`, `vibration`,
  and `freezed`/`json_serializable` (added when entities need them).
- Riverpod is pinned to `^3.0.0` (see the Changed entry above). The spec's 2.x
  `StateNotifierProvider` examples (02b §2.1) are adapted to the modern
  `Notifier`/`NotifierProvider` API when the state layer is built.
- `analysis_options.yaml` omits the spec's `prefer_relative_imports` rule
  because it contradicts `always_use_package_imports`; the project enforces
  full package imports (spec 03 §1.5).
