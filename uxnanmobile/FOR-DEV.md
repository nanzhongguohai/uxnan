# FOR-DEV — pending developer work

Deferred implementation work (code the team/agent will do later). Distinct from
`FOR-HUMAN.md` (assets only a human can provide). Search the codebase for
`FOR-DEV:` to jump to the exact deferral sites.

## Status

**MVP wired — Android alpha-ready.** All core modules are implemented and
connected to live bridge data, validated on-device against a real bridge.

**Built (DONE):**

- **Large screens: one route table, two layouts.** Past 840 dp the app stops
  being a stack of screens — a **permanent navigation drawer** (the PC, its
  work, and you) with the routed screen as the content pane beside it. The
  route table does not change: a single `ShellRoute` wraps the flat routes and
  `AppShell` decides *where* each screen draws, so every deep link and push
  notification keeps working at both widths. What changes is the meaning of a
  tap (`pane_navigation.dart`: opening **replaces** the pane instead of
  stacking). **Two panes is the ceiling** — Settings splits internally into its
  own two, and nested splits measure their own constraints rather than the
  window. Files and git deliberately stay a stack inside the pane: a third
  column helps nobody on a tablet. The new-conversation form is a full-screen
  dialog on a phone and a bounded 560×720 one on a wide window.

  `UxnanBreakpoint` implements the guide's five window classes and is the single
  place a width becomes a layout decision; `NeScaffold` clamps every screen to
  its class's content width, and `TwoPaneScaffold` serves both the shell and the
  nested splits.

- **Spaces: projects ▸ worktrees ▸ conversations, with per-folder git.** The
  conversation list is grouped by the folder work runs in, and a **repository**
  level appears over folders that `git/worktrees` relates to each other (never
  guessed from path prefixes — a worktree can live anywhere, and grouped ones
  share a prefix across repositories). Each level has
  its own ordering (status / activity / created / name) through a routed
  cascading menu. Folder rows carry git indicators (uncommitted, ahead, behind)
  from `git/status` per cwd, throttled and only while visible; the breakdown
  lives in the long-press sheet.

- **Overview + precise agent state.** The home screen is an **overview** (brand
  + avatar in the bar, a two-row greeting over live badges, PC cards built from
  `NeBadge`), and the profile screen no longer duplicates its identity card. The
  thread row shows the desktop's five agent states — **derived** from turn
  events, queue state, sign-in and the pending approval/question blocks, never
  reported by the bridge (see `architecture/02a` §5.4.2). Icons throughout are
  Hugeicons via the `UxIcons` catalogue and the `UxIcon` primitive, matching the
  desktop app and the website.

- **E2EE crypto + secure transport** (X25519 + Ed25519 + HKDF + AES-256-GCM,
  handshake, seq/replay, outbound buffer, reconnect loop).
- **Pairing & onboarding** — `OnboardingScreen`, `QrScannerScreen`,
  `MyDevicesScreen`, **`ManualCodeScreen`** (bridge-first manual-code pairing,
  `GET /pair/resolve?code=`, host typed or picked from mDNS discovery; the
  code is sent to **only** the host the user chose — never fanned out to
  discovered candidates, since it is a shared secret and mDNS records are
  spoofable). The devices screen shows a **network-path badge** (LAN /
  Tailscale / Direct / Relay, `NetworkKind`) on the connected PC, derived from
  the actual live endpoint rather than the coarser relay/direct
  `bridge/status` flag.
- **Direct LAN/Tailscale transport** — `DirectTransportSelector` tries each direct
  `hosts` entry from the QR first, falls back to the relay.
- **Multi-PC connection-targeting** — all live actions target the PC we actually
  hold a channel to; browsing is read-only. `bridge/status` consumed (Relay /
  Direct transport indicator). The devices card shows the **real connected
  endpoint** (the direct host that won the dial race, or the relay — carried on
  `connectedEndpointStream`), not the first advertised host, and **blurs it by
  default with tap-to-reveal** so the network topology isn't exposed at a glance.
- **Profile & metrics (bridge-owned, survivable).** A **Profile** screen (Devices
  app-bar avatar + a Settings header) aggregating activity across every paired PC
  — a GitHub-style contribution heatmap (Combined / Conversations / Messages /
  Work, per year, tap-a-day / tap-outside-to-clear), stat tiles (time connected,
  longest session, agents used, conversations, messages, sessions, git actions,
  most-used transport, models) and a per-agent breakdown — plus a **per-PC
  details** screen (device-card ▸ Statistics) and a customizable name + avatar.
  The metrics now come from the bridge's complete global ledger (`metrics/get`),
  so they survive app uninstall, device restore and conversation deletion. The
  root app shell keeps the controller alive and re-fetches on every connection,
  before Profile is opened. Android backup excludes secure-storage files and iOS
  uses a non-migrating Keychain class, preventing a trusted phone identity from
  being cloned onto another device. The phone keeps a per-PC snapshot display
  cache (`MetricsCacheStore`) and falls back to local drift aggregation only when
  the cache is empty. A profile **"Backup"** section adds **Export / Import** of a
  complete bridge-sealed, tamper-proof ledger (`metrics/export` /
  `metrics/import`), with EN/ES strings; a
  rejected export surfaces the **bridge's own reason** verbatim. The stats carry
  a **manual refresh** button (always available) and a persisted **refresh mode**
  — automatic (on every profile open, the default), a 5/15/30/60-min poll, or
  manual-only — in Settings ▸ *Metrics & provider usage*, which also names and
  explains the provider-usage group (each provider's remaining limits). The
  per-agent usage/credit view stays Phase B (the `agent/usageStats` item below).
- **Live streaming conversations** that survive leaving/re-entering the screen
  (per-thread in-memory buffers + `turn/list` re-sync) with a per-thread
  **"Responding…"** activity indicator. Timeline auto-follow yields to manual
  scrolling, stays detached while older content is being read, and resumes at
  the bottom or through an explicit jump/send action. **Full mid-turn recovery**:
  closing/killing the app during a turn and reopening restores everything the
  agent produced while away — the resync **re-seeds the live buffer
  unconditionally** from the bridge's accumulated record (which persists before
  notifying, so replacing never loses data), a resync also fires on **every
  (re)established connection** (the bridge's catch-up replay window is bounded),
  the finalized bubble always carries the **authoritative final text**, and every
  completed turn **reconciles via `turn/read`** so the stored message converges
  to the bridge's exact text↔work-log interleave. `beforeText`-flagged blocks
  (parallel/subagent activity) slot before the open text run, never splitting a
  sentence mid-word. The connected active idle conversation also polls its
  newest `turn/list` page every three seconds, so completed turns written from a
  supported native agent client appear without reopening the screen. Both the
  external user prompt and assistant reply persist; Mobile-authored prompts are
  matched by turn id instead of duplicated. This is completed-turn convergence,
  not cross-client token streaming; Antigravity has no readable history source.
- **Message queue** — a follow-up sent while the agent is working joins the
  thread's queue (owned by the bridge, so it drains with the app closed) instead
  of being blocked. A floating **"Queue message"** action appears above the
  composer only when a draft is waiting on a busy thread; it shares one slot with
  jump-to-latest and the turn-context shelf, so exactly one of the three shows at
  a time, and the composer's own Send/Stop button and Enter-inserts-a-newline
  behaviour are unchanged. A waiting message is **pinned to the bottom** of the
  timeline (below the streaming reply) as an ordinary user bubble wearing a
  **dashed outline** (`NeDashedOutline`), with **edit + cancel** in its corner:
  it keeps the user's own tone and its whole message, and only that edge says
  "not sent yet". On delivery the dashes dissolve in place, so the bubble never
  moves or changes colour — it just stops being provisional. On agents whose CLI
  has an input channel mid-turn (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, pi) that moment comes
  **without waiting for the turn to end**: the bridge hands the message to the
  running turn and reports `delivered` (`stream/turn/delivered`), which also
  retires edit/cancel since the agent already has it. On every other agent it
  settles when the queue drains, exactly as before.
  **Edit** withdraws it to the composer leaving no trace; **cancel** leaves the
  bubble marked. Editing over a busy composer saves that text as a draft, behind
  a **Drafts** pill beside the queue button that opens the shared
  `ComposerPaletteCard` (two lines each, restore/delete/clear-all) and restores
  **only into an empty composer**. A banner
  offers *Send them* / *Discard* when the bridge holds the queue after a stop or
  a failure. Gated on `bridge/status` → `features.messageQueue`, so an older
  bridge keeps the pre-queue behaviour. Resync re-reads
  `queuedTurnIds`/`queuePaused` and settles every waiting bubble against the
  bridge's view, so a message whose fate we missed never stays a ghost.
- **Message scroll rail** — a reusable, dependency-free right-edge minimap
  (`message_scroll_rail.dart`, one faint tick per user message) that is hidden
  while the timeline sits at the bottom and slides in from the right edge when
  the user scrolls up (the same signal that reveals *Jump to latest* and hides
  the composer ribbon). A slight drag reveals a dock-style fisheye + a message
  preview and, on release, glides (ease-in/out with a final settle) to that
  user bubble. Fed by a memoized `railAnchorsProvider`; honors reduced-motion.
  The centered floating **Jump to latest** (down) and git-history **Back to top**
  (up) shortcuts pair with it.
- **Structured agent turns** — assistant replies without a bubble, consecutive
  text merged, borderless tonal **Work log (N)** / **Thinking** process
  disclosures (collapsed by default and exclusively expanded per turn),
  durable native response boundaries that keep every progress/final message,
  a localized **N previous messages** disclosure for settled earlier replies,
  collapsible **Changed files (N) · +a −d** with per-file diffs, **Copy
  response**, **Last edits** strip above the composer; **Thinking** remains
  settings-gated. Long user text defaults to a ten-line expandable preview and
  still copies in full.
- **New conversation flow** — `project/list` + `agent/list` + `agent/models` +
  **folder browser** (`workspace/browseDirs`) to root a thread anywhere. The
  full-screen Neural Expressive dialog compares agents in one dynamic-corner
  card group; selecting an agent expands only its capability chips and
  collapses the previous selection. Starting one in a fresh worktree sends
  **no path**: the bridge places the checkout under the folder it manages, the
  same one the desktop uses, gated on `features.managedWorktrees`. Against an
  older bridge (which requires a path) the phone derives one, now spelled the
  way the desktop spells it — the two used to disagree, so one project's
  worktrees ended up in two folder schemes.
- **Workspace file browser + viewer** — lazy git-aware tree, repo-wide fuzzy
  search with relative-path results, ancestor reveal and hidden pre-positioning
  of the selected row; editable highlighted text, selectable diffs,
  GitHub-flavored Markdown with guarded relative resources, README HTML
  (including tables, `<kbd>`, `<sub>`/`<sup>`), **alert callouts**, **`<details>`
  disclosures**, task lists, `:emoji:`, and syntax-highlighted, horizontally
  scrollable fences; remote README shields typed by their response rather than
  their URL and drawn by `jovial_svg` so their labels are legible; animated GIF,
  raster/SVG zoom, SVG Preview / Source / Changes parity, and native Android/iOS
  PDF preview. A file an agent cites in a response is tappable (Markdown link,
  bare path or inline code) and opens in that same viewer — resolved on the PC
  via `workspace/resolveFileLink`, so a citation into another worktree works.
  See `docs/file-viewer.md` for the exact matrix and boundaries.
- **Structured model picker** (readable names, default badge, Claude alias
  "(latest)" + pinned versions + resolved-version row, `thread/setModel`), with
  a **Settings ▸ Models** switch to hide Claude Code's `isLatestAlias` "(latest)"
  entries and show only pinned versions (display-only; persisted locally).
- **Per-model run-option knobs** (data-driven: `enum` / `toggle`, generic
  renderer).
- **Agent slash commands in the `/` palette** — the agent's own commands
  (`agent/commands`, `AgentCommand` + `agentCommandsProvider`) are listed above
  the client-side entries; picking one inserts `/<name> ` and a matching
  `/name args` send is routed as a real command (`turn/send` `command`), any
  other text sent verbatim. Generic renderer (unknown/`headlessSupported:false`
  hidden), so new agent commands appear with no app change.
- **Context-usage indicator** (percentage when the model window is known, raw
  token count otherwise; **0 baseline** for agents with `reportsContextUsage`).
- **Context-compaction milestones** — durable `CompactionContent` blocks render
  at their real segment position with localized cause/token metadata. Codex,
  Claude, OpenCode and pi report them; Zero/Grok ACP and Antigravity do not
  expose a trustworthy signal, so mobile never guesses.
- **Active-agent contract only** — the shared contract no longer exposes
  retired standalone CLIs, so mobile needs no product-specific legacy filters.
- **Per-agent sign-in status** (`auth/status`) — banner above the composer, red
  dot in the threads list, "Check sign-in" in the new-conversation card,
  auto-refresh on app resume.
- **Interactive approval** (Approve / Reject / "always allow this session") with a
  spring `AnimatedSize` morph; validated end-to-end against Echo, Claude Code
  (`PreToolUse` hook), Codex (`app-server`) and
  OpenCode (`opencode serve` `permission.asked`). Only pi has no pre-tool channel
  (it runs autonomously).
- **Interactive question** (the agent's multiple-choice `question` tool) —
  single/multi-select option card that morphs to a resolved summary, persisted
  per `questionId`; answered via `turn/send { questionResponse }`. Validated
  end-to-end against OpenCode's `question` tool.
- **Composer** — focus-responsive floating pill (narrower/shorter idle,
  expanded and subtly elevated while active, without a focus outline);
  **independent voice → text**
  (`speech_to_text`) beside contextual Send/Stop; a collapsible turn-context
  icon shelf with a left-aligned 38 dp visual rhythm (48 dp touch targets) for
  data-driven reasoning options and color-coded approval mode;
  a compact in-turn circular **Agent responding…** cue; **image and file attachments**
  in an anchored "+" menu (photo library — **multi-selection**, up to
  10 per message — / camera / document file picker up to 10 MB, attachment-only
  message allowed, gated by the agent's `images` capability). Pending attachments sit
  **inside** the pill above the field as a 56 dp horizontally scrolling strip
  with a per-item ✕ (images as thumbnails, files as chips), and the pill morphs from
  its stadium ends to a 24 dp rounded surface while they are there; once sent, the
  same strip (72 dp) renders **above** the user bubble — tap to open the image full size.
- **Per-PC threads** (`Thread.deviceId`) with per-agent filter chips, search /
  sort / density, archived-thread screen, per-thread actions (rename / archive /
  unarchive / delete / copy id), **Remove device** (unpair), **Copy thread ID**
  for CLI resume.
- **Full Git** — full-screen `GitScreen` (per-file `git/diff`, branch switch with
  auto-stash, smart PR dialog, undo-commit, `git/revert`, `git/deleteBranch`,
  `git/removeWorktree`, etc.) with a focus-responsive commit composer aligned
  to the conversation composer's Neural Expressive geometry and elevation.
- **FCM push** (gated) — Android LIVE; deep-link to conversation; **personalized
  copy** + foreground suppression; per-channel notification preferences (Replies /
  Errors).
- **Settings** — theme mode (System/Light/Dark) + a **custom-theme library** with a
  dedicated Theme Manager (single/dual-brightness themes, live-preview grid,
  multi-select bulk delete/export, JSON import/export); language (EN/ES, follows
  device or picker); notification preferences.
- **In-app update checker** (*no silent install*) — check on launch/resume
  throttled by a **configurable interval** (every launch / 6h / 12h / 24h default
  / 48h / weekly / monthly), the installed **current version**, a *Check now*
  action, and an **in-section download → install** flow in **Settings → Updates**
  (plus the dismissible *Update available* banner on Threads, in sync). Android
  supports both Google Play In-App Update **flexible** flow and **direct APK
  updates** (queried from Bridge LAN `/app/version` or a configured custom update
  server, downloaded in-app with live progress, prompting with `AppUpdateDialog`,
  and installed via native Android `FileProvider` + `ACTION_VIEW` package
  installer); iOS = App Store version lookup (`dio` iTunes) + StoreKit
  `SKStoreProductViewController` overlay. A flexible update is **resumable**: the
  download outlives the app that starts it, so a check re-reads the stage Play
  reports (`AppUpdateStatus.installStage`) and picks the flow back up — an update
  left downloaded returns as *Install now*, and a pending one bypasses the check
  interval on every foreground. **Partially device-verified** (Android Play flow:
  the first real Play test exposed the stuck-flow bug now fixed — see
  `CHANGELOG.md`; Direct APK verified across bridge HTTP endpoints and native
  installer channel. iOS is inert until the App Store listing exists).

- **i18n** — full app translated (EN + ES) via `flutter gen-l10n`.

iOS is **not yet built** (the Podfile is generated on the first macOS build) and is
blocked on the Apple assets in [`FOR-HUMAN.md`](FOR-HUMAN.md). Everything still
pending is below.

## FOR-DEV: keep the R8 keep rules complete (release minification is ON)

`android/app/build.gradle.kts` keeps `isMinifyEnabled = true` +
`isShrinkResources = true` for `release`. R8 full mode (AGP 9 default) had stripped
the no-arg constructors of the reflectively-instantiated ML Kit (`BarcodeRegistrar`)
and Firebase (`FirebaseMessagingKtxRegistrar`) registrars
(`NoSuchMethodException: <init>[]`), breaking the QR scanner and background push in
`--release`; `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` now keeps those. Watch for
regressions: if a **new** reflective dependency works in debug but breaks only in
`--release`, add its keep rule (debug doesn't minify, so it won't catch it). Always
re-test a real QR scan **and** a background push in a `--release` build before
shipping.

## App-side pending work (no live bridge needed)

- [ ] **Bridge-update: fixed "About" row in Settings.** The bridge-outdated
      **banner** (thread list) and its data are done — `bridgeUpdateProvider`
      exposes `{ currentVersion, latestVersion }` from `bridge/status`
      (`updateAvailable`/`latestVersion`), and `BridgeStatus` parses both. What's
      left is a **fixed, always-visible row** in **Settings → About** showing the
      bridge version and an "update available" hint. It was intentionally **not**
      added on the current Settings screen to avoid a large collision with the
      in-flight settings overhaul on `feat/settings-updates-overhaul` (which
      rebuilds the settings landing + adds About/Licenses screens). **Unblocks
      when that overhaul merges:** add the row to the new About section, reading
      `bridgeUpdateProvider` (no new data/contract work needed).
- [ ] **Mermaid diagrams in the Markdown preview.** A ```` ```mermaid ```` fence
      renders as highlighted source (the honest fallback); GitHub draws the
      diagram. Needs a pure-Dart renderer or an explicit diagram placeholder in
      `MarkdownCodeBlockBuilder`
      (`presentation/screens/conversation/files/widgets/markdown_blocks.dart`);
      deferred because the mobile stack deliberately carries no WebView
      (`architecture/02a` §5.4.7).
- [ ] **Project drift repository** — the `projects` table exists; the repository +
      `AgentConfig` wiring lands with the projects module.
- [ ] **OPTIONAL — a display buffer for streamed prose, decoupled from arrival.**
      Nothing is broken; this is *perception*, not throughput, and it is written
      down only so the reasoning is not lost. On a long reply the text lands at
      roughly **6 repaints per second**, because that is how fast it arrives, and
      that can read as slightly stepped even though each repaint is now cheap.
      The idea: put incoming deltas in a queue and consume it at a steady rate,
      taking more characters per frame as the backlog grows (e.g. 2 under 30
      queued chars, 7 at 80, 12 at 200, 20+ past 500) — and **drain the queue
      hard on `turn/completed`**, so the UI never mimes typing an answer that
      already finished, which is the failure mode this pattern usually ships
      with. Site: `ThreadManager._rebuildActiveTimelineCoalesced` /
      `_streamCoalesceWindow` (`application/managers/thread_manager.dart`).
      **Prerequisite met:** it was correctly deferred until a rebuild was cheap,
      and after the settled-chunk split (2026-08-11) it is — p95 11 ms and flat
      in reply length. **Do not instead lower the coalescing window:** measured
      across twelve samples the repaint rate already sits well under what the
      window allows, so that change buys nothing (see `docs/architecture.md`).
      Decide it with the app in hand, and re-measure with the recipe in
      [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).
- [ ] **Work-log auto-expand while streaming; tap Last-edits strip to jump.** Low.
- [ ] **Adopt `freezed`/`json_serializable`** if/when entity boilerplate warrants it.
      Optional.

## App-side pending work (needs relay/bridge changes to start)

- [ ] **Manual pairing over the relay for a phone with no direct path to the
      PC at all.** `ManualPairingService.resolve`
      (`infrastructure/pairing/manual_pairing_service.dart`) needs a direct
      HTTP path (LAN or Tailscale) to the chosen host, reachable from the
      phone right now. A phone with neither — cellular data only,
      the PC not yet joined to Tailscale — can't resolve a pairing code at
      all. Fetching the payload through the relay instead of the current
      direct `GET /pair/resolve` would remove that requirement entirely, but
      needs a new relay+bridge+shared contract (the relay has no route to
      reach an unpaired bridge on the phone's behalf today). Not started.

- [ ] **`git/statusBatch(cwds[])`, if the per-folder git turns out to cost
      too much.** The folder list asks `git/status` once per visible folder;
      fifteen folders on screen is fifteen requests. It is bounded already
      (connected PC only, visible folders only, one per folder per 15 s, and
      the real refresh arrives on the status bus rather than by polling), so
      this is deliberately **not** built yet — measure on a real PC with many
      folders first. If it does bite, one batched method replaces N round
      trips without changing anything in the UI: `workspaceGitProvider` is the
      only caller. Written down so the option is remembered, not so it is
      implemented on spec.

- [ ] **Pull-request indicators (number, checks, merged / integrated /
      abandoned).** `uxnandesktop` derives these from `gh` running locally;
      the bridge can only **create** PRs (`git/createPr`) and has no way to
      query them. Showing them on the phone needs a new `shared/` + `bridge/`
      method (and `gh` present on the PC) — not another provider on mobile.
      **Not scheduled in any phase**, and left out of the folder-git work on
      purpose: inventing a PR state the bridge cannot report would be worse
      than not showing one.

- [ ] **Manual ordering, as a fifth option on each level (OPTIONAL).** The
      three levels of the threads list — projects, worktrees and agents — offer
      status / activity / created / name today. A hand-arranged order was asked
      for and deliberately left out: unlike the other four it is not a
      comparator but a *stored* per-item position, so it needs somewhere to
      persist (per PC, since paths mean nothing across machines), a drag mode
      on a three-level tree, and a rule for where a newly-arrived item lands.
      It **layers on without rework**: one more value in `ListSort` plus a
      reorder mode; nothing about the current sorting has to change to make
      room for it. Marked optional on purpose — the four comparators cover the
      questions the list is actually asked.

## App+bridge seams (need a live bridge to finish/verify)

- [ ] **Access-mode enforcement for non-Claude agents** — Claude and **Codex**
      now enforce the per-turn access mode (see `bridge/CHANGELOG.md`
      "per-turn access-mode enforcement"). Remaining: **Codex mid-thread re-apply**
      — the posture is set at `thread/start`, so changing the access mode partway
      through an existing Codex thread only affects threads started afterward
      (tracked in `bridge/FOR-DEV.md`). pi/OpenCode can't gate tools (no headless
      pre-tool channel), so they don't map `accessMode`. Verify the live behavior
      per agent.
- [ ] **Plan/to-do block per-agent on-device validation** — decode + render are
      done; the tool names/shapes are still ASSUMED for Codex/OpenCode/pi. Verify
      against a real turn per agent and adjust the mappers.
- [ ] **Automated integration test against a real bridge** — today the tests drive
      a simulated in-memory bridge. Add a real-bridge integration test for
      regression safety.
- [ ] **OpenCode/pi interactive approvals** — blocked on the bridge side (their
      headless modes expose no pre-tool channel; see `bridge/FOR-DEV.md`). The app
      already renders approvals for Echo/Claude/Codex/OpenCode/Zero/Grok.
- [ ] **AI-provider usage stats (`agent/usageStats`) — live verification.** The
      **bridge reader** (`bridge/src/usage/usage-reader.ts`) and the **mobile
      "Usage & credit" section** (profile: per-provider quota windows, plan,
      credit; `usageStatsProvider` + `ProviderUsage`, shown only when connected)
      are **implemented**. Remaining: **verify on-device against a real bridge**
      with signed-in providers — confirm each provider's live response maps
      correctly (Codex / Claude / Copilot / Grok) and the offline /
      not-installed / auth-required / error states render right.

## iOS (all blocked on the first macOS build + FOR-HUMAN assets)

iOS has never been compiled (the Podfile is generated on the first macOS build).
The following are pending and tracked as assets in `FOR-HUMAN.md`:

- [ ] iOS camera permission macro (`permission_handler` Podfile `PERMISSION_CAMERA=1`).
- [ ] `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` + `NSBonjourServices` (LAN/Tailscale direct).
- [ ] `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` (+ camera) for image attach.
- [ ] `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` + `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` (voice).
- [ ] iOS APNs end-to-end (paid Apple account + APNs `.p8` in Firebase).

## Release / CI-CD

- [ ] **First signed release run** — `.github/workflows/{ci-mobile,release-mobile}.yml`
      both exist (verify gate + AAB → Google Play **open-testing** (beta) track via
      `r0adkll/upload-google-play`); signing is wired in `build.gradle.kts` and the
      secrets are loaded (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64`, key password/alias,
      `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`, `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_BASE64`). What remains is
      executing the first tagged release and confirming the Play upload.
- [ ] **In-app version checker — on-device verification.** The checker is
      implemented (`infrastructure/updates/app_update_service.dart` +
      `presentation/providers/update_providers.dart`, wrapping
      `in_app_update_flutter`): an interval-throttled check on launch/resume
      (configurable: every launch / 6h / 12h / 24h default / 48h / weekly /
      monthly), the installed **current version**, a *Check now* action, and an
      **in-section download → install** flow in **Settings → Updates** (plus the
      dismissible *Update available* banner on the threads list, in sync). Android
      drives the **Play In-App Update** API (**flexible** flow: background download
      with real % + in-app install); iOS looks up the **App Store** version
      (`dio`) and presents the store page via StoreKit. The first real Play run
      surfaced the **stuck-flow bug** (a started update could never be finished and
      then read as "up to date"), fixed with the resume path — see `CHANGELOG.md`.
      **Still pending:** re-run the **whole** Android flow on a **Play
      open-testing (beta) track** build (a sideloaded APK always reports "no
      update"), covering what unit tests can't: that a real *Install now*
      **restarts into the new version**; that an update left downloaded comes back
      as installable after force-stopping the app; and that killing the app
      mid-download still resumes. The iOS path is inert until the App Store
      listing exists (`FOR-HUMAN.md`).
- [ ] **Settings restructure + update flow — functional validation on device.**

      The sectioned settings (General / Workspace / System landing → per-section
      screens, About with the app logo, open-source licenses) and the reworked
      update flow (in-section download → install, configurable interval) pass
      analyze + widget/unit tests, but their **runtime behaviour** hasn't been
      exercised on a real device yet (the maintainer is reviewing the UI). Verify
      the license list actually populates on-device (the provider now surfaces a
      load error with a retry instead of a blank list), navigation into each
      section, and the update download/install states, in the next build.
- [ ] **Exact `waiting` for threads the phone has never opened.** The list can
      tell "working" from "waiting for you" because `ThreadManager` records the
      approval/question blocks it sees. That is exact for a thread the phone has
      streamed or resynced, and it is **in-memory only**: after a restart, a
      thread that asked before the app closed reads as `working` until the next
      `turn/list` resync replays its blocks. It never claims a `waiting` that
      isn't there, so the failure is silence, not a lie — but a thread that has
      been holding for hours deserves better than a spinner.
      Making it exact is a **contract change**, not a client fix: the bridge is
      the only side that always knows, so it needs to say so — either a
      `stream/thread/state` notification or a field on `thread/list`. That
      touches `shared/`, `bridge/` and this app together. Site:
      `presentation/providers/agent_run_state_provider.dart`.
