# Changelog — @uxnan/shared

All notable changes to the shared contracts package are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — thread lifecycle streaming notifications

- Added `StreamNotification.ThreadStarted` (`'stream/thread/started'`),
  `StreamNotification.ThreadDeleted` (`'stream/thread/deleted'`),
  `StreamNotification.ThreadArchived` (`'stream/thread/archived'`), and
  `StreamNotification.ThreadUnarchived` (`'stream/thread/unarchived'`) in
  `src/jsonrpc/notifications.ts`, along with their param types
  `ThreadStartedParams`, `ThreadDeletedParams`, `ThreadArchivedParams`, and
  `ThreadUnarchivedParams`.
- Allows connected clients (such as multiple mobile devices connected to the
  same bridge) to synchronize thread creation, deletion, and archiving in
  real time.
- Extended `TurnAttachment` in `src/models/workspace.ts` to support file
  attachments (`type?: 'image' | 'file'`), preserving the original `fileName?: string`
  and optional `size?: number`.

## [0.0.15-alpha.20260813] - 20260813
### Fixed — the README badge undercounted the methods

`69 methods` on the badge against `70 JSON-RPC methods` in the prose two lines
below it, with `METHOD_NAMES` holding 70. The bridge's README carried the same
stale badge. Both now say 70.

### Changed — `git/createWorktree` can let the bridge place the worktree

`GitWorktreeParams.path` is now **optional**. Omitted (with `managed`), the
bridge resolves the location itself, under the same managed layout the desktop
uses: `<home>/uxnan/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>` by default, configurable to the
old `<repo>--<branch>` sibling or to a root of the user's own.

This closes a real divergence rather than adding an option. The path used to be
derived by every client, and the two derivations had drifted: for one repository
and one branch, the desktop produced `<repo>--<branch>` and the phone
`<repo>-<branch>`, with different sanitizing rules — so the same project's
checkouts ended up split across two folder schemes depending on which app made
them.

`BridgeFeatures.managedWorktrees` says whether a bridge can do this. It is
additive, like every other flag there: absent means the bridge still requires
`path`, and a client that supports older bridges keeps deriving one as its
fallback.

## [0.0.14-alpha.20260810] - 2026-08-10

### Added — `git/worktrees`

Which directories are worktrees of the repository at a `cwd`:
`{ worktrees: [{ path, branch?, isMain, isLocked? }] }`, main worktree first.

It exists because a repository's worktrees are **siblings on disk** — a
checkout of `repo` at `../repo-feature` is a peer directory with no path
relationship to its main worktree — so a client cannot infer the hierarchy and
has to be told. Any client that guessed from path prefixes was guessing.

`METHOD_NAMES` is now **70** entries.

### Removed

- Removed the standalone Gemini CLI from the shared `AgentId` and
  `UsageProvider` contracts. Gemini-family model ids supplied by active agents
  remain ordinary model data.

## [0.0.13-alpha.20260804] - 2026-08-04

### Added — a conversation gets a real name, not its opening words

- Added `Thread.titleSource` (`prompt` | `agent` | `user`) and the
  `stream/thread/renamed` notification, bringing the streaming set to **11**.
  A generated title may replace a provisional one; **nothing** replaces a name
  the user chose.
- Added `ThreadRenameParams.source`. Absent means the user renamed it — the safe
  default, since `thread/rename` is the hand-rename call. A client that
  auto-names a new thread from its opening message must send `'prompt'`, or its
  throwaway title is recorded as the user's choice.
- Added the optional `IAgentAdapter.generateTitle`. It is a **side errand, not a
  turn**: implementations run a one-shot with no session id, so nothing lands in
  the thread's history, and they use the agent's *cheapest* model — naming is
  not work for the model the conversation runs on.
### Added — mid-turn delivery of a queued follow-up ("steering")

- Added `AgentCapabilities.steering`: the agent can take a follow-up **into the
  turn already running**, the way a CLI picks up what you type while it works
  instead of making it wait for the next turn.
- Added the `delivered` `TurnStatus` and `Turn.deliveredIntoTurnId`. A queued
  turn handed to a running one is terminal and *successful* — deliberately not
  `cancelled`, which means the user dropped it. The user's message stays in the
  thread with no assistant message of its own; the reply belongs to the turn it
  was folded into.
- Added the `stream/turn/delivered` notification (`{ threadId, turnId,
  intoTurnId }`), bringing the streaming set to **11**. A client flips the
  bubble out of its queued state in place and stops offering to edit or cancel
  it, because the agent already has it.
- Added `BridgeFeatures.midTurnDelivery` so a client asks whether the bridge can
  do this rather than inferring it from a version, matching how `messageQueue`
  is already gated.
- Added the optional `IAgentAdapter.steerTurn(options & { activeTurnId })`.
  Returning `false` means "not taken" and is an ordinary outcome, not an error:
  the bridge leaves the turn queued and it runs next, so a refusal costs the
  user a wait and nothing else.

## [0.0.12-alpha.20260803] - 2026-08-03

### Added — workspace file-link target contract

- Added `workspace/resolveFileLink { cwd, href }` and
  `WorkspaceFileTarget { cwd, path }`, allowing a client to open an agent-cited
  file through the existing workspace viewer even when the resolved file lives
  in a different worktree from the conversation.

### Added — assistant response boundaries

- Added the durable `AssistantResponseBoundaryBlock` metadata contract. It
  separates multiple native assistant messages produced inside one turn while
  leaving their prose as ordinary ordered text segments.

### Added — explicit compaction and agent-deprecation contracts

- Added the durable `CompactionContentBlock` (`type: 'compaction'`) with an
  optional normalized reason and before/after token counts. Adapters carry it
  through the existing `stream/content/block` path, so no parallel streaming
  protocol is needed.
- Added optional `AgentCapabilities.reportsCompaction` so clients can distinguish
  a real protocol signal from agents where compaction is opaque.
- Added optional `AgentDescriptor.deprecated`. A deprecated adapter remains
  identifiable to legacy consumers but must not be offered for new work.
- Marked the retained `gemini-cli` agent id and `gemini` usage provider as
  deprecated contract values; Antigravity is the active successor.

## [0.0.11-alpha.20260729] - 2026-07-29

### Added — a thread message queue (follow-ups sent while a turn is in flight)

The agent CLIs all let you type a follow-up while they work and hold it for the
current turn to end. The contract now describes the same thing for the phone,
with the queue owned by the bridge (it must survive the app being backgrounded
or killed — the whole point is to send and pocket the phone).

- **`TurnStatus`** gains `queued` and `cancelled`. `cancelled` is deliberately
  distinct from `aborted`: `aborted` is a turn that was *running* and got
  stopped, `cancelled` is one that was *queued* and removed before it ever
  started. A queued turn that is cancelled is kept in the thread, not deleted,
  so the user's message stays visible and marked rather than vanishing.
- **`TurnSendParams.queue`** — `true` queues explicitly behind an in-flight turn,
  `false` rejects with the new `AgentBusy` error instead, and **absent queues
  anyway**. Queueing is the safe default: the bridge can only drive one turn per
  thread (half the agents run one-shot per turn, so a second concurrent turn
  would put two CLI processes on the same session), and until now a second
  `turn/send` silently clobbered the in-flight one.
- **`TurnSendResult`** gains `queued` and `queuePosition` (1-based).
- **`TurnList`** gains `queuedTurnIds`, `queuePaused` and `queuePausedReason` —
  live bridge state a client re-attaches to on resync, exactly like
  `activeTurnId`.
- **`queue/resume`** and **`queue/clear`** (+ `QueueStateResult`) — after the
  user stops a turn or one fails, the bridge holds the queue instead of firing
  the follow-ups at a stopped or broken agent; these resume or drop it.
- **`stream/turn/cancelled`** and **`stream/queue/updated`** notifications. The
  latter carries the whole queue state rather than a delta, so a client that
  missed one converges on the next instead of drifting.
- **`JsonRpcErrorCode.AgentBusy`** (`-32009`).
- **`BridgeStatus.features`** (`BridgeFeatures`, first entry `messageQueue`) —
  additive capability advertisement so a newer client offers a feature only
  where it works, instead of inferring it from the version string. Absent means
  "assume none". This is not cosmetic for the queue: a client that offers to
  queue against a bridge that cannot makes it start a second **concurrent** turn,
  which corrupts the agent session (two CLI processes on one `--resume`, or
  OpenCode retiring the running turn) — observed live against a bridge from
  before this change.

### Added — `IAgentAdapter.handlesAttachments()` (optional)

- Declares that an adapter delivers `SendTurnOptions.attachments` to its CLI
  itself, so the bridge must not materialize them to files nor append a path
  note. Default (unset) keeps the CLI-agnostic file-path delivery.
- An adapter opts in when its protocol carries images natively **and** its file
  tools cannot open one — Zero's ACP advertises `promptCapabilities.image` while
  its `read_file` is line-oriented text.

### Added — `IAgentAdapter.defaultCwd()` (optional)

- Reports the directory an adapter runs a turn in when the turn carries no `cwd`
  of its own (its configured `AgentConfig.cwd`, else the daemon's process
  directory). Optional, so an adapter that cannot report one is unaffected.
- The bridge needs it to place per-turn files — image attachments in particular
  — inside the directory the CLI is actually sandboxed to: every supported agent
  refuses to open a path outside its workspace, so a file written anywhere else
  is unreachable no matter how it is referenced. See `bridge/CHANGELOG.md` and
  `architecture/02a` §5.8.12.

## [0.0.10-alpha.20260724] - 2026-07-24

### Clarified — `AgentModel` doc comments name the current Claude alias set

- `id` and `isLatestAlias` (`agents/agent-capabilities.ts`) documented Claude
  Code's aliases as `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`; the CLI also accepts `fable`, which
  the bridge now advertises. Comment-only — no wire shape, field or validator
  changed. The resolved-version example was refreshed to `claude-opus-5`.

## [0.0.9-alpha.20260721] - 2026-07-21

### Clarified — `metrics/*` backups contain the complete durable ledger

- The unchanged `MetricsSnapshot`/export/import wire shapes now explicitly
  define conversations, messages, reported tokens, sessions and Git actions as
  bridge-retained history. `MetricsImportResult.imported` counts every inserted
  or advanced ledger row, not only session/Git rows. This is a semantic
  clarification; method names and JSON shapes are unchanged.

## [0.0.8-alpha.20260720] - 2026-07-20

### Changed — `SECURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped to `2` (breaking wire change)
- The secure transport now binds `sessionId`/`seq`/direction as AES-GCM AAD on
  every envelope (see the `bridge` and `uxnanmobile` CHANGELOGs), so frames from
  v1 and v2 peers are mutually undecryptable. The version is bumped so both sides
  can reject the gap **during the handshake** — the last point they can still
  read each other — instead of connecting and then silently dropping every frame.
  Its doc comment now states the rule that was previously implicit: bump this
  whenever the *encrypted-frame* format changes, not only the handshake JSON.

### Added — `ENVELOPE_DIRECTION_PHONE_TO_BRIDGE` / `ENVELOPE_DIRECTION_BRIDGE_TO_PHONE`
- The AAD direction bytes (`0x01` / `0x02`) now live here, next to
  `HKDF_INFO_TAG`, as the single source of truth for a cross-language wire
  contract. `bridge/src/transport/secure-channel.ts` re-exports them and the
  mobile `ProtocolConstants` mirrors them, so neither side carries its own magic
  numbers.

## [0.0.7-alpha.20260719] - 2026-07-19

### Added — `antigravity-cli` agent id
- Added `antigravity-cli` to the `AgentId` union (`agents/agent-capabilities.ts`)
  — Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`), the successor to the deprecated standalone
  Gemini CLI (its models are the Gemini family). Consumed by the bridge (a new
  real adapter) and the mobile app (a new `AgentId.antigravity` value + visuals).
  No validator change: `AgentId` is a type-only union with no runtime enum schema.

### Added — `ContentBlockParams.beforeText` (ordering hint for parallel-activity blocks)
- **`stream/content/block` gains an optional `beforeText?: boolean`**
  (`src/jsonrpc/notifications.ts`). `true` marks a block produced by a
  **parallel/background** activity (e.g. a Claude Code subagent's tool run) that
  arrived while the assistant's main text was still streaming: the client must
  insert it BEFORE the currently-open text run instead of appending it, so the
  run is never severed (appending rendered sentences split mid-word by a Work-log
  card). Additive and backward-compatible: absent/false keeps today's sequential
  append. The bridge applies the identical placement when persisting
  `Message.segments`, so the live view and a `turn/list` re-sync render the same
  interleave. Spec: `architecture/02b` §1.4.

### Docs
- Sync the JSON-RPC method-count badges, the AGENTS.md agent roster (add Grok), the npm publish status and the PR-template test count with the code.

## [0.0.6-alpha.20260716] - 2026-07-16

### Added — profile metrics (`metrics/*`) contract
- **Three new JSON-RPC methods** (`src/jsonrpc/methods.ts` + `METHOD_NAMES`, now
  **66 entries**) that make the mobile profile metrics durable by moving ownership
  to the bridge (they were phone-local and lost on an app uninstall):
  - **`metrics/get`** — `void` → `MetricsSnapshot`: the requesting PC's aggregated
    stats (conversations, distinct agents/models, messages, git actions, sessions,
    total/longest connected time, relay-vs-direct split, per-agent breakdown,
    member-since, and per-day activity buckets for the heatmap). The bridge is the
    source of truth; the phone renders one snapshot per PC and sums across PCs.
  - **`metrics/export`** — `{ passphrase? }` → `{ blob, filename, passphraseProtected }`:
    the bridge seals its metrics event log into an opaque, **tamper-proof** file
    that only the SAME bridge can later verify + decrypt (so users can't fabricate
    or edit their stats). Optional passphrase adds a second confidentiality layer.
  - **`metrics/import`** — `{ blob, passphrase? }` → `{ imported, snapshot }`: feed a
    previously exported file back; the bridge rejects a foreign/edited file, then
    merges its events **by id** (idempotent).
- **New models** (`src/models/metrics.ts`, exported from the package root):
  `MetricsSnapshot`, `MetricsAgentUsage`, `MetricsActivityDay`, `MetricsTransport`,
  and the `metrics/export`|`import` param/result shapes. `MetricsActivityDay.day`
  is **UTC midnight of the calendar date** (timezone-stable, so the phone's
  heatmap maps it to the right cell in any timezone).
- **`MetricsSnapshot.byAgentDay`** (`MetricsDayBreakdown` + `MetricsAgentDay`):
  per-day activity split per agent (UTC-midnight day keys) — conversations,
  messages and **tokens processed** each day — for the unified agent-activity
  view (per-agent totals all-time, or a single day when a heatmap cell is
  picked). Tokens are throughput (sum of each turn's reported usage), not billed
  cost — caching/pricing differ; `agent/usageStats` stays the source for money;
  0 for agents that don't report usage (e.g. Zero).
- Provider usage/credits are deliberately **excluded** — those stay live-read via
  `agent/usageStats`, never persisted.

### Added — agent commands (`agent/commands`) contract
- **New JSON-RPC method `agent/commands`** (`src/jsonrpc/methods.ts` +
  `METHOD_NAMES`, now **63 entries**): discover an agent's special ("slash")
  commands. Params `{ agentId, cwd? }` → `{ commands: AgentCommand[] }` (`cwd`
  scopes discovery so a project's own custom commands are included).
- **New models** (`src/agents/agent-capabilities.ts`): `AgentCommand =
  { name, description?, argumentHint?, source: 'acp'|'builtin'|'custom',
  headlessSupported? }` and `AgentCommandInvocation = { name, args? }`.
- **`turn/send` gains `command?: AgentCommandInvocation`** — invoke a discovered
  command instead of free-form `text`; the bridge resolves it to the prompt the
  agent runs (an expanded custom template, or the CLI's native `/name args`
  form). `text` is optional when `command` is present.
- **`AgentCapabilities` gains `commands?: boolean`.** The adapter contract
  (`src/agents/agent-adapter.ts`) gains optional `listCommands?(cwd?)` and
  `expandCommand?(name, args?, cwd?)`, and `SendTurnOptions` gains `command?`.

### Added — richer `agent/usageStats` fields (account type, reset credits, $ balance)

- `ProviderUsage.account` gains **`accountType`**
  (`AccountType = 'subscription' | 'payAsYouGo' | 'free' | 'team' | 'enterprise'`),
  derived per provider so a client can identify the account beyond its plan name.
- `ProviderUsage` gains **`resetCredits`** (`{ available, totalEarned?,
  nextExpiresAt?, entries?: { title?, expiresAt? }[] }`) — a provider's redeemable
  rate-limit "resets" (Codex), with per-credit detail (which one, when each expires).
- `CreditBalance` gains **`available`** — a remaining $ balance the provider reports
  directly (e.g. Grok on-demand / prepaid).
- All additive: older payloads deserialize unchanged. Contract mirrored in
  `architecture/02b`; desktop reader implemented, bridge/mobile consume in Phase 6.

## [0.0.5-alpha.20260711] - 2026-07-11

### Changed — Grok usage provider

- Extended the `agent/usageStats` `UsageProvider` union with `grok` for the
  desktop's Grok CLI billing reader and future bridge/mobile consumers.

### Added — `grok` in the `AgentId` union
- **`AgentId`** (`src/agents/agent-capabilities.ts`) gains **`'grok'`** — xAI's
  coding CLI, driven by the bridge over the Agent Client Protocol (`grok agent
  stdio`). Additive change; no other contract shape changes (the per-agent config,
  capabilities, model and auth contracts are already keyed generically by
  `AgentId`). Consumers that don't recognize the id degrade gracefully (the mobile
  app maps unknown wire ids to `custom`).

### Added — `agent/usageStats` method + provider-usage models
- **New JSON-RPC method `agent/usageStats`** (`src/jsonrpc/methods.ts` +
  `METHOD_NAMES`, now **62 entries**): read AI-provider usage statistics —
  quota/rate windows (percent consumed + reset), plan/account, and credit
  balance — for the providers the caller activated. Params
  `{ providers: UsageProvider[] }` → `{ usage: ProviderUsage[] }`.
- **Usage models** (`src/models/usage.ts`, exported from the package root):
  `UsageProvider` (`codex`/`claude`/`copilot`/`gemini`/`grok`), `UsageStatus`
  (`ok`/`authRequired`/`notInstalled`/`error`), `UsageSource` (`token`),
  `UsageWindow`, `CreditBalance`, `ProviderUsage`, and the
  `UsageStatsParams`/`UsageStatsResult` request/response shapes.
- **Posture:** the contract reads usage only from the CLI's own stored token
  (→ the provider's official usage API) — never browser cookies or pasted API
  keys. Access is per-runtime by design: the desktop reads these files natively
  in Rust today; the bridge will read them in TS for the phone (Phase 6). See
  `architecture/02a` §5.8.10 and `02b` (`ProviderUsage` contract). The bridge
  and mobile handlers are owed follow-ups (their `FOR-DEV.md`).

## [0.0.4-alpha.20260703] - 2026-07-03

### Changed — npm releases publish to the `latest` dist-tag
- `release-npm.yml` now publishes to **`latest`** (was `alpha`) and pins
  `@uxnan/shared` for bridge/relay via `dist-tags.latest`, so `npm install`
  resolves the newest release. `alpha`/`beta` are opt-in, added manually. A
  one-time manual `npm dist-tag add` is needed to move the already-published
  packages' `latest` forward — see `VERSIONS.md`.

### Added — version-compare util + `BridgeStatus` update fields
- **`compareVersions(a, b)` / `isNewerVersion(candidate, current)`**
  (`src/version/compare.ts`): dependency-free SemVer 2.0.0 precedence
  comparison (date-stamped `-alpha.YYYYMMDD` prereleases ordered numerically,
  `+build` metadata ignored, unparseable inputs sort lowest). Lets the bridge
  decide "is the published version newer than mine?" without a `semver`
  dependency. Exported from the package root; 7 new tests (`test/version.test.ts`).
- **`BridgeStatus.latestVersion?: string` + `BridgeStatus.updateAvailable?: boolean`**
  (`src/models/session.ts`): the bridge's own background npm update check reports
  the latest published version and whether it is strictly newer than the running
  one, so the phone can surface a "bridge update available" hint **without
  querying npm itself**. Backward-compatible optional fields (absent when the
  check hasn't run or is offline). Reflected in `architecture/02b`
  (`BridgeStatus` contract + `bridge/status` result).

## [0.0.3-alpha.20260702] - 2026-07-02

### Added — `AgentModel.isLatestAlias` (flags moving-target "latest" aliases)
- **`AgentModel.isLatestAlias?: boolean`** (`src/agents/agent-capabilities.ts`):
  a presentation-only flag marking a moving-target "latest" alias — Claude
  Code's `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`, each of which always routes to the newest
  version of its tier (the resolved concrete id is on `version`). Concrete /
  pinned models leave it absent. Lets a client (the mobile app) offer to hide
  the aliases and show only exact pinned versions **without hardcoding ids**.
  Backward-compatible optional field; consumers tolerate it being absent.
  Reflected in `architecture/02b` (`AgentModel` contract + the `agent/models`
  field list).

## [0.0.2-alpha.20260628] - 2026-06-28

### Added — `workspace/searchFiles` (repo-wide fuzzy file search)
- **New JSON-RPC method `workspace/searchFiles`** (`SearchFilesParams` →
  `WorkspaceSearchResult` with `WorkspaceMatch[]` + `truncated`) — a fuzzy file
  search across the whole repository that honors `.gitignore` (and excludes
  `.git` + sensitive files, like `workspace/list`). Backs the mobile composer's
  `@`-mention picker; reusable for a future file-browser search. Added to
  `methods.ts`, `models/workspace.ts` and `METHOD_NAMES` (now **61**). See
  `architecture/02a` (workspace §) and `02b` (method list).

## [0.0.1-alpha.20260627] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`Message.segments?`** (`models/thread.ts`): the `turn/list` assistant
  message now carries its text runs and structured blocks **in the order the
  agent produced them** (each entry a serialized `MessageContent`; text runs as
  `{ type:'text', text }`). When present, a client renders from this so the work
  log sits inline with the response instead of all activity collapsing above one
  merged paragraph — fixing recovered conversations after a reconnect. `content`
  (the full concatenated text) and `blocks` are retained for older clients and
  for re-sync reconciliation (the segment text runs concatenate to `content`;
  the non-text segments are exactly `blocks`). Wire-additive and emitted only
  when a structured block is present; older clients ignore it and fall back to
  `content` + `blocks`. Produced by the bridge (`thread-store.ts`), consumed by
  mobile (`turn/list` resync + live re-attach).
- **`WorkspaceEntry.ignored?`** (`models/workspace.ts`): optional boolean on
  `workspace/list` entries marking the ones git ignores (a `.gitignore` /
  exclude match), computed by the bridge per-listing via `git check-ignore`.
  Lets the mobile file browser *dim* ignored entries (muted + italic) apart from
  tracked/untracked files. Deliberately **not** a `GitFileStatus` — ignored
  entries never appear in `git/status`, so the flag rides on the listing.
  Backwards-compatible (new optional field, no method change); consumed by the
  bridge (`workspace/list`) and mobile (file browser). Mirrors the desktop ADE's
  own file-tree dimming (its `FsEntry.ignored`, a desktop-local type).
- **`TurnList.activeTurnId?`** (`models/thread.ts`): the `turn/list` result now
  carries the turn currently in-flight for the thread (the bridge's live
  AgentManager state), when one exists. Distinct from a stored turn's
  `streaming` status — which can dangle after a bridge restart — so the phone
  uses it to re-attach its streaming view to a turn it stopped tracking while
  backgrounded (instead of treating the turn as ended). Wire-additive; older
  clients ignore it. Consumed by bridge (`turn/list` handler) and mobile
  (resync re-attach).

### Changed
- **`git/log` pagination is now an opaque offset cursor** (`models/git.ts`):
  `GitLogParams.cursor` / `GitLogResult.nextCursor` are documented as an opaque
  token (an offset over a topologically-ordered log) instead of a commit SHA —
  the bridge switched off the `<cursor>^` scheme that dropped commits across
  merge boundaries. Wire shape is unchanged (still a `string`).

### Added
- **`WorkspaceEntry.mtime`** (`models/workspace.ts`): optional last-modified
  time as epoch milliseconds on `workspace/list` entries (files only; absent for
  directories / unreadable entries), so the mobile file browser can show a
  "modified" timestamp on each file. The bridge fills it from the same `stat` it
  already runs for `size`. Backwards-compatible — a new optional field, no method
  added, no wire break.
- **Git commit refs + a `git/commitShow` method** (`models/git.ts`,
  `jsonrpc/methods.ts`, `jsonrpc/method-registry.ts`): `GitCommit.refs?:
  GitRef[]` carries the per-commit decoration (HEAD / local branch / remote
  branch / tag) for the history graph; a new `GitRef`/`GitRefType` model backs
  it. New `git/commitShow { cwd, sha } → GitCommitDetails` returns a commit's
  metadata (incl. `refs`), the `GitCommitFile[]` it touched (status, `oldPath`
  on renames, per-file additions/deletions, `binary`), and the full unified
  `diff` (with `diffTruncated` when capped).
- **`SendTurnOptions.accessMode`** (`agents/agent-adapter.ts`): the per-thread
  access mode is now carried into each turn so adapters can map it to their
  permission posture (Claude wired; others ignore it for now).
- **Agent session id + per-thread access mode on the wire** (`models/thread.ts`,
  `jsonrpc/methods.ts`, `jsonrpc/method-registry.ts`): `Thread.agentSessionId?`
  (the agent CLI's native session id, for "resume from the CLI"), a new
  `AccessMode` union (`requestApproval | approveForMe | fullAccess`) +
  `Thread.accessMode?`, and a `thread/setAccessMode { threadId, mode }` method
  (returns the updated `Thread`) so the per-thread approval mode persists
  server-side.
- **`turn/list` newest-first pagination** (`jsonrpc/methods.ts`,
  `models/thread.ts`): `TurnListParams.fromEnd?: boolean` (return the newest
  `limit` turns) and `TurnList.total?: number` (full turn count). Lets a client
  open a long thread at its most recent messages and page backward by computing
  offsets, instead of pulling the whole thread. Backward-compatible (both
  optional; an older client/bridge ignores them).
- **Git revert + safe branch/worktree deletion + cwd probe** (`jsonrpc/methods.ts`,
  `jsonrpc/method-registry.ts`, `models/workspace.ts`): `git/revert`
  (`GitRevertParams`), `git/deleteBranch` (`GitDeleteBranchParams`, `force`),
  `git/removeWorktree` (`GitRemoveWorktreeParams`, `force`) and `workspace/exists`
  (`WorkspaceExistsParams` → `WorkspaceExistsResult { exists, isGitRepo? }`).
  Deletion is fail-safe by default (git refuses an unmerged branch / dirty
  worktree unless `force`); the probe lets the phone detect a thread whose `cwd`
  vanished.
- **Interactive approval contracts** (`models/approval.ts`, `jsonrpc/methods.ts`,
  `agents/agent-adapter.ts`): `ApprovalDecision`
  (`approve | reject | approveSession`), `ApprovalResponse`
  (`{ approvalId, decision }`) and `ApprovalRequestBlock` (the `approval`
  content-block payload the phone renders). `TurnSendParams.approvalResponse?`
  lets the phone answer a pending approval on `turn/send` (no new turn), and
  `IAgentAdapter.respondApproval?(threadId, approvalId, decision)` routes the
  decision to the agent adapter. The request side reuses the existing
  `stream/content/block` channel (an `approval` block) — no new notification.
- **Turn image attachments** (`models/workspace.ts`, `jsonrpc/methods.ts`,
  `agents/agent-adapter.ts`): a new tolerant `TurnAttachment`
  (`{ type?, mimeType, base64Data?, path?, width?, height? }`) plus
  `TurnSendParams.attachments?` and `SendTurnOptions.attachments?` so the phone
  can ride inline images on `turn/send`. `TurnSendParams.text` is now **optional**
  (an image-only message is valid); the bridge rejects only a turn with neither
  text nor attachments. Unblocks the mobile "Attach" composer end-to-end.
- **`AgentCapabilities.reportsContextUsage`** (`agents/agent-capabilities.ts`):
  optional per-agent flag for whether the agent reports per-turn token/context
  usage (`usage` on `turn/completed`), so the phone can show a context meter at
  0 before the first turn. Optional/back-compat (absent = false). Set by the
  Claude and Codex adapters; OpenCode leaves it false.
- **Per-model run-option knobs** (`agents/agent-capabilities.ts`,
  `jsonrpc/methods.ts`, `agents/agent-adapter.ts`): a new `AgentModelOption`
  (`{ key, kind: 'enum'|'toggle', label, values?, default? }`) plus an optional
  `AgentModel.options` so `agent/models` can advertise the run-option knobs a
  model supports (today: a `reasoning` effort enum). `TurnSendParams.options`
  and `SendTurnOptions.options` (`Record<string, string|boolean>`) carry the
  user's chosen values back on `turn/send`; the bridge maps them to each CLI's
  flag. The legacy flat `effort` still works as a fallback for `reasoning`.
  Consumers must ignore unknown `kind`s (forward-compatible). Phase 2 of the
  per-model run-options seam.
- **Per-project agent/model pin fields** (`agents/agent-config.ts`,
  `models/project.ts`): `AgentConfig` gains an optional `model` (a project's
  pinned default model, alongside the existing `agentId`/`cwd`), and `Project`
  gains an optional `model` next to `agentId`. The bridge fills these from its
  `projectAgents` config so `project/list` advertises a project's pinned
  agent/model and `thread/start` can default to them when the phone omits them.
- **Thread lifecycle methods** (`jsonrpc/methods.ts`, `jsonrpc/method-registry.ts`):
  `thread/rename` (`ThreadRenameParams { threadId, title }` → `Thread`),
  `thread/archive` / `thread/unarchive` (`{ threadId }` → `Thread`) and
  `thread/delete` (`{ threadId }` → `void`). The mobile app already called these
  best-effort; they are now part of the contract so the bridge can implement them
  and the changes survive a reinstall or a second device.
- **Token usage on `turn/completed`** (`jsonrpc/notifications.ts`): new
  `TurnUsage { tokens, contextWindow? }` and optional `usage` on
  `TurnCompletedParams`, so the bridge can report a turn's context consumption
  (and the model's window when known) for the phone's context indicator.
- **`stream/model/resolved` notification** (`jsonrpc/notifications.ts`):
  `StreamNotification.ModelResolved` + `ModelResolvedParams { threadId, turnId,
  model }`. Carries the concrete model an agent resolved an alias to for a turn
  (e.g. `opus` → `claude-opus-4-8`), and a `'model_resolved'` `AgentStreamEvent`
  kind for adapters to emit it.

### Changed
- **`auth/status` is now per-agent** (`jsonrpc/methods.ts`): its params changed
  from `void` to `{ agentId }`, matching the spec's per-agent `getAuthStatus`
  (the phone queries the active project's agent). The `AuthStatus` result is
  unchanged and remains sanitized — it never carries tokens/keys.
- **`agent/models` now returns structured models** (`jsonrpc/methods.ts`,
  `agents/agent-capabilities.ts`): `AgentModelsResult.models` changed from
  `string[]` to **`AgentModel[]`** (`{ id, displayName, description?, version?,
  isDefault? }`). `id` is the routing key (Claude alias, `provider/model`, or a
  Codex model id); the rest are presentation hints. The adapter contract
  `IAgentAdapter.listModels?()` returns `AgentModel[]` accordingly. Lets the
  phone show readable names, the default model, and an alias's resolved version.
- **Pairing payload transports** (`e2ee/pairing-payload.ts` + Ajv schema): `relay`
  is now **optional** and a new optional **`hosts: string[]`** carries the bridge's
  direct `host:port` addresses (LAN + Tailscale `100.x`). Validation requires **at
  least one** transport (`relay` or `hosts`) and adds the `missing_transport` error.
  Enables LAN/Tailscale-direct pairing with no hosted relay. The mobile parser must
  tolerate a missing `relay` and prefer `hosts` (try direct → relay).

### Added
- **Plug-and-play directory browsing contracts** (`models/workspace.ts`):
  `BrowseRoot`, `BrowseDirEntry`, `BrowseResult`, and the `workspace/browseDirs`
  method (`{ rootId?, path? }` → `BrowseResult`) added to the method registry +
  `METHOD_NAMES`. Lets the phone navigate sub-directories under a configured base
  root, see which are git repos, and pick any directory as a thread's cwd. Additive
  — existing consumers are unaffected (the mobile Dart side adds it when it builds
  the browser UI).
- Streaming notification contracts (`StreamNotification` + param types:
  turn started/delta/completed/error/aborted) in `jsonrpc/notifications.ts`.
- `'echo'` added to `AgentId` (built-in reference/dev agent).
- **Per-thread agent/project contracts**: `Thread.agentId|model|cwd`
  (`models/thread.ts`), `StartThreadParams.agentId|model|cwd` and
  `SendTurnOptions.cwd` so a thread is pinned to an agent/model/working directory.
- **Agent discovery contracts**: `AgentDescriptor` (`agents/agent-capabilities.ts`)
  plus methods `agent/list` (`AgentListResult`) and `agent/models`
  (`AgentModelsParams` → `AgentModelsResult`); `IAgentAdapter.listModels?()`
  (optional) for runtime model discovery.
- **Project resolution contracts**: methods `project/list` (`Project[]`) and
  `project/resolve` (`{ cwd } → Project`).
- **`thread/setModel`** method (`ThreadSetModelParams`) to repoint a thread's model
  mid-conversation.
- **Push registration contracts**: methods `notifications/register`
  (`RegisterNotificationsParams`), `notifications/update`
  (`UpdateNotificationsParams`) and `notifications/unregister`.

### Changed
- **Pairing QR encoding is now Base64 of the UTF-8 JSON** (was plain JSON), to
  match the mobile `PairingPayload.fromQrString` (`base64.decode` → `jsonDecode`,
  spec 02a §5.5.4). `encodePairingQr` / `parsePairingQr` updated accordingly.

### Added
- Initial `@uxnan/shared` contracts package (TypeScript, ESM, Node ≥18).
- JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope types and constructors (`makeRequest`, `makeNotification`,
  `makeResponse`, `makeErrorResponse`) plus type guards.
- JSON-RPC error codes (`JsonRpcErrorCode`) including Uxnan-specific codes
  (-32000..-32008) and the `RpcError` class.
- Typed method registry (`JsonRpcMethodRegistry`, `MethodParams`, `MethodResult`)
  and a runtime method list (`METHOD_NAMES`, `isKnownMethod`) kept in lock-step
  via a compile-time assertion.
- E2EE types: handshake messages (`clientHello`/`serverHello`/`clientAuth`/`ready`),
  the canonical transcript builder (`buildHandshakeTranscript`), the encrypted
  `SecureEnvelope`, and the v2 `PairingPayload` with validation/parse helpers.
- Protocol constants mirroring the mobile `protocol_constants.dart`.
- Domain models: thread/turn/message, git, workspace, project/auth, session/trust.
- Agent contracts: `IAgentAdapter`, `AgentCapabilities`, `AgentConfig`.
- Push payloads and runtime validators (Ajv) for requests, responses, E2EE
  envelopes, pairing payloads and push payloads.

### Notes
- JSON Schemas are authored as typed TS objects under `src/validators/json-schema/`
  (rather than standalone `.json` files as sketched in the architecture) so they
  are bundled, type-checked, and free of ESM import-attribute friction.
- The pairing QR string uses compact JSON; the exact encoding must be verified
  against the mobile `PairingPayload.fromQrString` before real pairing.
