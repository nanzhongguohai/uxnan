The local control-plane daemon that connects the [Uxnan](../README.md) mobile app
to your PC over an end-to-end-encrypted channel. It is the **heart of the
product**: it holds the secure connection to your phone, runs Git and reads your
workspace on request, and drives the AI coding agents on your behalf, routing
JSON-RPC methods to per-domain handlers.

The product is **bridge-first**. The mobile app pairs with the bridge and tries
its direct LAN / Tailscale addresses first; the [relay](../relay/README.md) is an
optional, self-hosted off-LAN fallback. Background push notifications are sent
**by the bridge itself** (FCM HTTP v1) over any transport, so the phone keeps
receiving them whether it reached the bridge directly or through a relay.

> **Status:** alpha-functional on the primary path (LAN/Tailscale-direct,
> bridge-direct push), with **seven active real agents wired**. The detailed breakdown of
> what is built and what remains lives in [`FOR-DEV.md`](FOR-DEV.md); the release
> history is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Why the bridge matters

The bridge is small on purpose, but it is where the design decisions that make
Uxnan distinct actually live:

- **One bridge, many projects.** You start the bridge **once**, from a single
  location of your choosing, and it gives the phone access to **all** the projects
  underneath it — Git repositories or plain folders alike. There is no need to
  launch a separate process per project: the phone browses the configured roots
  (`workspace/browseDirs`, constrained by the `browseRoots` setting) and roots a
  new conversation anywhere it is allowed to look.
- **New worktrees land where the desktop puts them.** `git/createWorktree` takes
  no path from the phone any more: the bridge places the worktree itself, under
  `~/uxnan/worktrees/<project>/<branch>` by default — the same layout
  `uxnandesktop` resolves — so one repository's checkouts stay grouped whichever
  app created them. Configurable per install (`worktrees` in
  [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md)), and existing worktrees are
  never moved.
- **Conversation links follow the agent across worktrees.**
  `workspace/resolveFileLink` canonicalizes a local path cited in a response.
  Relative paths start at the conversation cwd; an absolute or `..` path can
  select a sibling Git worktree as the viewer root. Only an existing regular
  file is returned, and `.git` plus sensitive path segments remain denied.
- **Provider-agnostic, with no keys to hand over.** For each agent the bridge
  spawns that agent's **official local CLI** and talks to it over stdio. It never
  uses a provider HTTP API, API key, or language SDK. Each CLI runs under the
  account or subscription you already authenticated on the machine, and the bridge
  only orchestrates it.
- **Effortless discovery.** A freshly started bridge advertises itself on the
  local network over mDNS (`_uxnan._tcp.local`), so the phone can find it without
  typing an address. Pairing is by QR (which carries the bridge's direct
  `host:port` list) or by a short manual code (`GET /pair/resolve?code=`) when a
  camera is not convenient. Multi-homed PCs advertise explicitly through each
  eligible IPv4 interface instead of trusting the OS multicast route. Discovery
  is not authorization: the pairing code is never advertised, choosing a result
  only fills the host, and the normal operator-gated E2EE enrollment still runs.
- **The transports it brings up.** On start, the bridge runs a direct LAN
  `http + ws` server (which also serves Tailscale addresses transparently) and,
  optionally, maintains a relay pairing session for off-LAN reach. The phone
  chooses the best available path; you do not have to.
- **End-to-end encryption is not optional.** Every byte to and from the phone is
  sealed with the documented E2EE protocol (X25519 + HKDF + Ed25519 +
  AES-256-GCM). Responses are sanitized before they leave the machine — for
  example, `auth/status` reports sign-in per agent and **never** returns a token.

## How the bridge drives agents

This is the mechanism behind "provider-agnostic": the bridge spawns each supported
agent's official local CLI — `opencode`, `claude`, `codex`, `pi`, `agy`, `zero`, `grok` — as a
child process and drives it over stdio, exactly as you would in a terminal (Zero is
driven over the Agent Client Protocol, `zero acp`). Prompts are
passed as `argv` elements with `shell:false` (no shell injection), in the thread's
working directory — except Claude Code, whose prompt travels on an open stdin
pipe (`--input-format stream-json`) so a follow-up can reach it mid-turn.
The bridge parses each CLI's native stream and re-emits it as
structured events — `stream/content/block` (command / diff / tool) plus
`stream/thinking/delta` (reasoning) — so the phone renders the same shape no
matter which agent is running.

Codex, Claude and pi also emit durable assistant-response boundaries. The
bridge reconciles terminal payloads additively, preserving every progress and
final message in native order instead of replacing the turn with its last item.

The conversation is also shared with the agent's own clients. On every idle
`turn/list`, the bridge merges completed native-session turns that were written
outside Uxnan: Codex Desktop/CLI, OpenCode Desktop, Claude Code, pi, Zero and
Grok are supported. Existing bridge turns remain authoritative and are linked
rather than duplicated. OpenCode is read through its official local server API;
the others use their persisted session logs. Antigravity is the explicit gap:
`agy` exposes neither a readable transcript nor a history export, so no history
is inferred from its opaque database.

The standalone Gemini CLI is intentionally unsupported. Antigravity (`agy`) is
the active Google integration.

See [`FOR-HUMAN.md`](FOR-HUMAN.md) for the per-agent install / login
prerequisites, and [`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md) for the details.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g uxnan-bridge
```

## CLI

```bash
uxnan-bridge start            # start the daemon: LAN server + (optional) relay pairing session
uxnan-bridge status           # print current status as JSON
uxnan-bridge qr               # print the pairing QR in the terminal (with the manual code)
uxnan-bridge code             # print just the current pairing code
uxnan-bridge stop             # stop the running daemon (via the lock file)
uxnan-bridge install-service  # autostart at logon (Task Scheduler / LaunchAgent / systemd --user)
uxnan-bridge uninstall-service
```

**Pairing is time-boxed.** A first-time enrollment is only accepted while a
pairing window is open, so a device that never saw your screen can't enroll
itself over the LAN. The window opens for 5 minutes whenever you show the QR or
the code — and also when a phone successfully looks up the code, which is how
pairing works against a daemon started by `install-service` (there `uxnan-bridge
qr`/`code` run in a *separate* process, so **use the manual code**: a scanned QR
never contacts the daemon before the handshake). Already-paired devices
reconnect at any time and are never affected.

Logs are written to `~/.uxnan/logs/bridge-YYYY-MM-DD.log` (daily rotation, with a
secret-redaction pass) and to stderr. Autostart at login is configured by the
platform scripts under `scripts/`.

The bridge is the ecosystem's core engine, so `start`/`status`/`qr`/`code` also
print a one-line **"a newer bridge is available"** notice to stderr when the
running version is behind the latest published to npm (`latest` dist-tag). The
check is best-effort and cached in `~/.uxnan/update-check.json` (24h TTL);
**`start` always re-checks** (it bypasses the cache), so a release published
inside that window is announced the next time you start the bridge rather than
up to a day later. The result is also exposed to the phone via `bridge/status`
(`latestVersion`/`updateAvailable`).

The Ed25519 identity is stored in the OS keychain (Windows Credential Manager /
macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service) via `@napi-rs/keyring`. With no keychain
available, the bridge still runs with an in-memory identity (not persisted across
restarts).

## Architecture

- **Contracts.** Consumes [`@uxnan/shared`](../shared/README.md) for JSON-RPC and
  E2EE types and runtime validators. The bridge exposes **70 JSON-RPC methods +
  16 streaming notifications** (see `shared/src/jsonrpc/`); the mobile app keeps
  manually-synced Dart equivalents of the same shapes.
- **State.** Non-secret JSON under `~/.uxnan/` (atomic writes) —
  `daemon-config.json`, `pairing-session.json`, `threads/<threadId>.json`,
  `metrics.json`,
  `trusted-phones.json`, `push-state.json`, `update-check.json`, `agent-cache/`,
  `logs/`. `metrics.json` is the complete historical activity ledger; it keeps
  five rotating `.bak1` … `.bak5` generations and is not pruned when a thread is
  deleted. The Ed25519 identity and metrics sealing key are secrets kept in a
  `SecretStore`, never written in plaintext.
- **Routing.** `HandlerRouter.dispatchRaw()` validates the envelope and routes to
  registered handlers; errors map to JSON-RPC error codes (`-32000..-32009` +
  standard).
- **Agents.** An `IAgentAdapter` per agent (OpenCode / Claude Code / Codex / pi /
  Antigravity / Zero / Grok); `AgentManager` orchestrates streaming and broadcasts `stream/*`
  notifications to connected phones.
- **Push.** `PushService` (persisted by relay `sessionId`) delivers FCM HTTP v1
  directly via `createBridgePushSender` (lazy `firebase-admin`), with the relay
  `/push/notify` as a fallback.

The cross-component specification is `architecture/02a-system-architecture.md`
§5.8 and
[`uxnandesktop/architecture/02e-bridge-integration.md`](../uxnandesktop/architecture/02e-bridge-integration.md).

## Develop

```bash
# from the repo root (npm workspaces):
npm run build      # build @uxnan/shared then uxnan-bridge
npm test           # build + run all node:test suites
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit across packages
npm run format     # prettier --write
```

Requires Node ≥ 18. ESM-only. The test runner uses `--test-concurrency=1` on
Windows (see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for why). What is implemented versus
still pending — including the recipe for wiring the next agent — is tracked in
[`FOR-DEV.md`](FOR-DEV.md).
