/**
 * OpenAI Codex CLI adapter (real agent) — v2 `app-server` turn protocol.
 *
 * ## Why app-server (refactor of the old `codex exec --json` adapter)
 *
 * `codex exec` is one-shot and non-interactive: it does not surface tool
 * approvals, so the bridge couldn't actually gate sensitive tools — every
 * sensitive call was either auto-approved (with `-s workspace-write`) or
 * silently denied (with `-s read-only`). The `codex app-server` JSON-RPC
 * protocol is the same one the desktop app uses; it is turn-based and
 * surfaces the approval elicitations the bridge needs:
 *
 *   - `item/commandExecution/requestApproval`  (v2, current codex-cli 0.98+)
 *   - `item/fileChange/requestApproval`        (v2)
 *   - `item/permissions/requestApproval`       (v2)
 *   - `mcpServer/elicitation/request`          (v2 MCP servers)
 *   - `item/tool/requestUserInput`             (v2, EXPERIMENTAL)
 *   - `execCommandApproval`                    (v1, legacy)
 *   - `applyPatchApproval`                     (v1, legacy)
 *
 * All of these are routed to the bridge's existing `requestApproval` flow
 * (the same `approval` content block the Claude `PreToolUse` hook uses), so
 * the phone's approval card just works. See `codex-approval.ts` for the
 * per-kind mapping.
 *
 * ## Process model — the app-server lives for the turn, not for the session
 *
 * A `codex app-server` process is spawned lazily on the first turn, the bridge
 * speaks JSON-RPC over its stdio, and it is **shut down as soon as no turn is
 * in flight**. The next turn spawns a fresh one and re-attaches to the thread
 * with `thread/resume`.
 *
 * That handover is not an optimization, it is the contract: **Codex allows
 * exactly ONE writer per thread, held for as long as the thread is loaded in a
 * process.** A long-lived app-server therefore keeps every thread the phone has
 * ever touched locked, and Codex Desktop / `codex resume` answer
 * `thread <id> already has an active writer` — the phone's conversation cannot
 * be opened there at all. Measured against codex-cli 0.147.0:
 *
 *   - `thread/unsubscribe` replies `{status:'unsubscribed'}` but the thread
 *     STAYS in `thread/loaded/list` and the writer stays held — it does NOT
 *     hand the thread over;
 *   - once the holding process exits, another client's `thread/resume` succeeds
 *     immediately.
 *
 * So ending the process is the handover. It costs ~250ms to respawn plus
 * ~200–750ms to `thread/resume` (measured, the upper end on a 7k-line rollout),
 * paid once per turn against a model call that takes seconds to minutes.
 *
 * Threads still live inside the app-server for the duration of a turn, so
 * streaming, approvals and steering are unchanged. The bridge persists each
 * thread's `nativeSessionId` so both a later turn and a bridge restart resume
 * the same Codex thread instead of starting a new one.
 *
 * Captured app-server JSON-RPC events (one JSON object per line):
 *   { "method":"turn/started", "params":{...} }
 *   { "method":"item/agentMessage/delta", "params":{ delta } }
 *   { "method":"item/reasoning/summaryTextDelta", "params":{ delta } }
 *   { "method":"item/commandExecution/outputDelta", "params":{ delta } }
 *   { "method":"item/completed", "params":{ item:{ type:'commandExecution'|'fileChange'|'agentMessage'|'reasoning'|... } } }
 *   { "method":"turn/completed", "params":{ turn:{ id, items, status, error?, … } } }
 *   { "method":"thread/tokenUsage/updated", "params":{ threadId, turnId,
 *       tokenUsage:{ total:{ totalTokens, inputTokens, cachedInputTokens,
 *       outputTokens, reasoningOutputTokens }, last:{…}, modelContextWindow } } }
 *
 * Server requests that need a reply (handled by the bridge):
 *   { "id":N, "method":"item/commandExecution/requestApproval", "params":{...} }
 *   { "id":N, "method":"item/fileChange/requestApproval", "params":{...} }
 *   { "id":N, "method":"applyPatchApproval", "params":{...} }
 *   { "id":N, "method":"execCommandApproval", "params":{...} }
 *   { "id":N, "method":"item/permissions/requestApproval", "params":{...} }
 *   { "id":N, "method":"mcpServer/elicitation/request", "params":{...} }
 *   { "id":N, "method":"item/tool/requestUserInput", "params":{...} }
 *
 * See bridge/FOR-DEV.md (agent adapters) and bridge/docs/testing.md
 * (validating adapters).
