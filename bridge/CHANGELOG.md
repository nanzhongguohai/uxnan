# Changelog — uxnan-bridge

All notable changes to the bridge daemon are documented here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added

- **Antigravity token usage reporting.** Driving `agy` over `--output-format stream-json`
  exposes the native `result.usage` payload (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
  `thinking_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `total_tokens`), so Antigravity now
  advertises `reportsContextUsage: true` and turns report context usage.

### Changed

- **Antigravity persistent stream-json session.** Previously, Antigravity was invoked
  in one-shot mode (`agy -p`) per turn, triggering Google authentication checks and
  cold-start overhead (~4s+) on every turn. The adapter now maintains a resident `agy`
  child process per thread using `--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json`,
  dropping warm turn turnaround latency to ~1.6s. Idle sessions are automatically torn
  down after 24 hours of inactivity (`DEFAULT_ANTIGRAVITY_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`),
  with each new interaction automatically refreshing the countdown. Active sessions
  are also immediately dismantled when a thread is deleted (`thread/delete`) or
  archived (`thread/archive`), freeing backend memory instantly.
- **Pi persistent RPC session.** Previously, Pi Agent (`pi --mode rpc`) was spawned
  fresh for every turn, ending its stdin stream after each turn. For long threads,
  this caused multi-second disk re-parsing overhead of JSONL history, slow turn
  turnaround, and potential process race conditions. The adapter now maintains a
  persistent resident `pi --mode rpc` child process per thread with stdin held open,
  reusing the active session across turns as long as thread configuration (cwd, model,
  effort, permissionMode) remains unchanged. Idle sessions are automatically torn
  down after 24 hours of inactivity (`DEFAULT_PI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`),
  with each new interaction automatically refreshing the countdown. Active sessions
  are also immediately dismantled when a thread is deleted (`thread/delete`) or
  archived (`thread/archive`), freeing backend memory instantly.

## [0.0.24-alpha.20260903] - 20260903
### Changed

- **`typescript` is declared where it is used.** Every bridge script that
  matters (`build`, `typecheck`, `test`, `prepublishOnly`) runs `tsc`, but the
  compiler was only ever reached by hoisting from the monorepo root — so the
  package was not installable and buildable on its own. It now names the
  dependency itself; the resolved version is unchanged (5.9.3 satisfies both
  this floor and the root's).

### Fixed

- **An agent the bridge spawns no longer inherits a desktop terminal's
  identity.** The desktop ADE injects `UXNAN_AGENT_ID` plus its hook server's
  url/token (and the browser / MCP endpoints) into every terminal it opens, and
  environment variables are inherited by the whole process tree — so a
  `uxnan-bridge start` run **inside** one of those terminals handed that identity
  to every agent CLI it spawned, and their hooks reported to the ADE claiming to
  be that terminal: an agent card on a terminal where nobody launched an agent.
  Every spawn now runs with an explicit environment stripped of those keys
  (`agentEnv` in `src/adapters/spawn.ts`). The bridge's **own** approval-hook
  coordinates are unaffected: it sets them per turn, and what it sets wins over
  the scrub — only an inherited value is dropped. Same fix as the desktop's, on
  the other side of the same leak.

## [0.0.23-alpha.20260815] - 20260815
### Fixed — Antigravity's model list is usable again

Picking any Antigravity model on the phone failed the turn with *"invalid model
selection … is not recognized as a known model"*, and the picker listed
`Fetching available models...` as if it were a model — marked **Default**, so it
was what a fresh conversation ran on.

`agy models` changed shape between 1.1.4 and 1.1.13: it now prints a progress
line, then `<id>⟨TAB⟩<label>` rows. The parser still assumed one value per line,
so it took the progress line as a model and sent the **whole line** —
`gemini-3.7-flash-high⟨TAB⟩Gemini 3.7 Flash (High)` — as `--model`. It is now
read as two columns: the id routes (it already carries the reasoning tier, so no
`--effort` is passed) and the label is what the phone shows, which also gives
Antigravity the same two-line rows as every other agent in the model picker.
Bare-id output (older `agy`) is still accepted, and prose never becomes a
phantom model. A conversation whose stored model is the old whole-line value is
repaired on send instead of failing, so no thread needs re-picking.

Verified live against `agy` 1.1.13: `--model gemini-3.5-flash-low` and `--model
"Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)"` both run; the whole line is rejected.

### Changed — naming a conversation stops spending the working model's quota

Two fixes to the same idea: a six-word title must run on the cheapest model the
agent offers, never the one the user is working with.

- **Antigravity named on the account's frontier model.** The adapter passed no
  `--model` at all, so every title ran on `agy`'s default — while both the spec
  and the desktop app said it named on the cheap flash tier. It now passes
  `gemini-3.6-flash-low`, which is what they always claimed.
- **Codex names on `gpt-5.6-luna` instead of `gpt-5.4-mini`.** Luna is cheaper
  on both halves of the bill ($0.20/$1.20 per 1M tokens against $0.75/$4.50)
  and, measured on a real title, also spent fewer tokens (13.4k vs 18.3k) —
  about 5× cheaper per name. Its reasoning effort is pinned to `low` (`-c
  model_reasoning_effort=low`) because Luna defaults to `medium`, and thinking
  tokens are exactly what would undo the saving on a task this small.

The other five agents were audited in the same pass and were already correct:
Claude Code names on `haiku`, and OpenCode, pi, Grok and Zero route through many
providers, so they run on their own default rather than a pinned id that a
different provider set would reject. The desktop app pins the same ids for its
terminal-tab titles and moves with this change.

### Fixed — a Codex conversation started on the phone now opens in the Codex app

Starting a conversation on Codex from the phone made it **unopenable everywhere
else**: Codex Desktop (and `codex resume`, and an IDE) answered that the
conversation was not available. The bridge kept one `codex app-server` alive for
the whole session, and Codex allows exactly **one writer per thread**, held for
as long as that thread is loaded in a process — so every conversation the phone
had ever touched stayed locked, for days, by a process that was doing nothing.

The app-server is now spawned per turn and **released as soon as no turn is in
flight**, which is what hands the thread back; the next turn re-attaches with
`thread/resume`. Measured against codex-cli 0.147.0: `thread/unsubscribe`
answers `unsubscribed` but keeps the thread loaded and the writer held (it does
**not** hand over), while a second client's `thread/resume` succeeds the moment
the holding process exits. The handover costs ~250ms to respawn plus
~200–750ms to resume (the upper end on a 7k-line rollout), once per turn.

This completes the convergence documented in `architecture/02a` §5.8.8 in both
directions: turns written from Codex Desktop already flowed into the phone, and
the phone's own conversations are now openable there.

### Added
- Turns taken while another Codex client holds the conversation report **who has
  it** ("open in another Codex client… close it there") instead of the raw
  protocol error. If the rollout is gone (deleted from another client), the
  conversation continues in a fresh Codex thread rather than dead-ending.
- `thread/start` sets `threadSource: 'user'`. A person typed the message on
  their phone, so the thread is classified like every other human-started one —
  the app-server otherwise leaves the field unset, which no first-party Codex
  client does.
- **A restarted bridge continues the same Codex thread.** The native session id
  was persisted but never handed back, so after a restart the next turn opened a
  *new* Codex thread while the phone still showed the history (read off the
  rollout) — the agent had lost the context. The `AgentManager` now offers the
  stored id back through the optional `adoptNativeSession` capability, and only
  when it belongs to the same agent.
- **The conversation's name is mirrored onto the Codex thread**
  (`thread/name/set`, right after the bridge names a thread), so it is
  recognizable in Codex Desktop / `codex resume` instead of showing up
  untitled — a thread the bridge starts comes back with `name: null`, because
  every Codex client titles its own. `setNativeTitle` is an optional adapter
  capability, so agents whose CLI keeps no name are unaffected.

### Changed
- **Codex access mode applies mid-conversation.** The thread's
  `(approvalPolicy, sandbox)` now rides on every `thread/resume`, so changing the
  access mode from the phone takes effect on the next turn instead of only on
  threads created afterwards. Verified live: resuming a `never`/`read-only`
  thread as `on-request`/`workspace-write` wrote the new pair into that turn's
  `turn_context`. (Closes the matching `FOR-DEV` item.)

## [0.0.22-alpha.20260813] - 20260813
### Added — the bridge places worktrees itself, where the desktop places them

`git/createWorktree` no longer requires a `path`. Without one it resolves the
location from the new `worktrees` config — by default the managed root
`<home>/uxnan/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`, the same layout
`uxnandesktop/src-tauri/src/worktreeloc.rs` produces — and advertises
`features.managedWorktrees` on `bridge/status` so a client can ask instead of
guessing from a version string. A client that still sends a path gets exactly
that path, unchanged.

The point is that both apps place worktrees for the **same** repositories. The
phone derived `<parent>/<repo>-<branch>` and the desktop `<parent>/<repo>--<branch>`
with different sanitizing, so one project's checkouts were split across two
schemes depending on which app created them. The layout now exists once per
runtime, driven by one shared table of cases:
`src/git/worktree-location.ts` here, `worktreeloc.rs` there — including the
digest that disambiguates two projects with the same folder name, which both
sides pin to the same value.

What the resolver guarantees: the group is measured from the repository's
**main** worktree (so creating one from inside another does not nest), branch
names are folded into folder names valid on every OS (Windows-invalid
characters, trailing dots and spaces, reserved device names, length capped on a
word boundary), a taken destination takes the next free `-2`/`-3` suffix, and a
second project of the same name gets its own group.

`managed-worktrees.json` — declared since the daemon's first state layout and
never written — now records the worktrees the bridge placed, so a later cleanup
can tell them from checkouts that were already on disk. Only the ones it located
itself are recorded: a client-supplied path is the client's own arrangement.

### Configuration

- **`worktrees`** — `{ location: 'managed' | 'sibling' | 'custom', root?: string }`.
  Default `{ location: 'managed' }`. `sibling` reproduces the pre-managed
  `<repo>--<branch>`; `custom` puts the managed layout under `root`.

## [0.0.21-alpha.20260812] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed — a tool step could be announced after the sentence that followed it

The work log is ordered by the order the phone is told, and a content block was
told last. Its branch notified *after* awaiting the store write, and adapters
emit without awaiting the handler — so only a handler's synchronous prefix runs
in arrival order. A delta arriving during that write overtook the block: the
phone showed "Son 24." before the command whose output that sentence describes.

The block is now announced from the synchronous prefix, with the store write
following it, exactly as the streamed prose above already works. When something
becomes durable is a separate question from when the phone is told about it.

Found by CI rather than by a person: the ordering test had been asserting a
fixed 80 ms snapshot, which hid the reorder as a "missing" block; waiting for
the three notifications instead is what showed the real order.

## [0.0.20-alpha.20260812] - 2026-08-12

### Changed — streamed prose is coalesced before it leaves the bridge

Agents emit text in bursts, not at a steady rate: on a real OpenCode turn, 60%
of deltas arrived within 5 ms of the previous one (911 deltas, gaps p10 1.4 ms /
p50 3.0 ms / p90 27.7 ms). Each one was paying a JSON serialization, an AES-GCM
seal and a WebSocket frame for a handful of characters, and the phone paid the
mirror of that to open them.

Text deltas are now batched over a 25 ms window, or 512 characters, whichever
comes first. `stream/message/delta` carries the accumulated run, so nothing
changes shape on the wire or in the app — there are simply fewer, larger
deltas. Replayed over that recording the policy cut 911 notifications to 244
(3.7x); driven live it carried the same prose at 22.1 characters per
notification instead of 4.1. The window is the worst case a character can wait,
well under the ~100 ms at which a person notices a pause.

**Order is preserved, and that is the part with teeth.** Any non-delta event
flushes the open batch first, so a content block still lands against the text
run it belongs to (`beforeText`) and a turn's completion never overtakes the
prose before it. Adapters emit events without awaiting the handler, so only each
handler's synchronous prefix runs in arrival order — the delta is buffered
there, before its store write. Buffering it after that write let the completion
flush an empty buffer and arrive first, which the suite caught.

Durability is untouched: every delta is still persisted individually as it
arrives. The batching decides how often the phone is told, never when the
conversation becomes durable.

### Changed — one file per conversation, so a streamed reply stops fighting the disk

Replies arrived on the phone in lurches, and the longer your history got the
worse it was. The cause was not the phone: every streamed token mutates a
conversation, and while all of them lived in a single `threads.json` each token
re-read, re-serialized and rewrote the **entire** store.

Measured on a real 8.4 MB one: 36 ms to read and parse, 33 ms to serialize
(blocking the event loop) and 24 ms to write — **93 ms per delta**. Those calls
queue behind the store's mutex, and the notification to the phone is sent only
after the write, so the disk — not the agent — set the pace. Driving the real
OpenCode adapter with the same prompt against that store and against an empty
one: **116 s versus 26 s**, 5.8 deltas/s versus 24.5, with gaps between deltas
of 109 ms (p50) and 573 ms (max) versus 4 ms and 89 ms.

Conversations now live one per file under `~/.uxnan/threads/<threadId>.json`,
and only the conversation that changed is rewritten — a few KB in the median
case instead of the whole history. They are also held in memory between
mutations (this process is their only reader and writer, guaranteed by the
single-instance lock), which removes the re-read entirely.

**No durability guarantee changes:** every mutation still writes its file before
it resolves. Nothing is deferred, so there is no window in which a crash could
lose a reply.

The same measurement after the change: **19.2 s**, 38 deltas/s, gaps of 2.8 ms
(p50) and 161 ms (max) — the real store now performs like an empty one, which
was the whole point. A legacy `threads.json` is split into per-conversation
files on first read and kept as `threads.json.migrated`; verified against a real
store (79 conversations, 116 turns, 249 messages, byte-identical after the move).

### Fixed — a whole exchange stored twice after reading the agent's own log

A conversation came back doubled on the phone — the prompt **and** the reply,
identical copies that survived reopening it. The duplicate carried a second turn
id: the agent's own session id. `turn/list` reconciles the agent-owned
transcript on every idle read, and that turn was failing to match the bridge's
own record of the same exchange, so it was imported beside it.

The match compared the two turns message by message. They never line up: the
bridge accumulates **one** assistant message per turn, while these logs split
the same reply across several — one per tool step, most of them carrying no
prose at all (OpenCode writes a text-less message per tool call, Claude Code
likewise; Zero keeps the final answer without the preamble it streamed). So
every turn in which the agent used a tool mismatched and was imported a second
time. Turns that used no tool matched fine, which is why a short "hola" never
duplicated and a real question always did.

A turn is now identified by its content: prompt and reply, each concatenated
across however many messages carry it, compared ignoring whitespace — and, for a
log holding a different rendition of the same reply, by the same prompt plus one
reply containing the other plus a native start inside that turn's own run
window, all three required so a turn genuinely written elsewhere still imports.

Stores that already hold such a pair converge on the next idle read: the
imported copy is dropped once its bridge-created twin is recognized. Verified
against a real store — 12 duplicated turns removed across OpenCode, Claude Code
and Zero threads, with every bridge-created turn left intact.

## [0.0.19-alpha.20260810] - 2026-08-10

### Added — `git/worktrees`

Answers which directories are worktrees of the repository at `cwd`, parsed from
`git worktree list --porcelain`. Read-only, so it is not recorded as a git
action in the profile tally.

Outside a repository it returns an empty list rather than throwing: the caller
asks once per configured root, and a root that is not a repository is an
ordinary case, not an error.

The parser is exported and pure (`parseWorktreePorcelain`) so its shapes are
pinned as text — detached heads, locked worktrees, bare repos and branch names
containing a slash are all tedious to stage on disk and easy to get subtly
wrong. `isMain` is **positional**: git marks nothing, it simply prints the main
worktree first. Ten tests, one of which runs real `git` to prove the text being
parsed is the text git prints.

The bridge now exposes **70 JSON-RPC methods**.

### Removed

- Removed the standalone Gemini CLI adapter, resolver, hook reporter, session
  reader, usage reader, command parser and descriptor. Persisted daemon config
  drops only the retired `gemini-cli` id while preserving every active agent,
  including Antigravity and its Gemini-family models.

## [0.0.18-alpha.20260805] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed — Grok's token usage actually reaches the phone this time

0.0.17 claimed to fix Grok and did not: it accepted `_x.ai/session/update`,
while the update that carries the usage arrives on **`_x.ai/session_notification`**.
Captured off the live wire *while the adapter drove a real turn*, then verified
end to end through the adapter itself — `turn_completed` now emits
`{tokens: 24381, contextWindow: 500000}`.

### Fixed — Zero no longer claims a context meter it can never fill

0.0.17 flipped `reportsContextUsage` to true after reading a `provider_usage`
event out of Zero's session store. That event is real — and it is written only
for a session driven by `zero exec`. Verified by running the adapter and reading
the store it wrote: an **ACP-driven** session holds `message` events and nothing
else, so the meter showed and stayed at zero, which is worse than hiding it.

The capability is honest again and the reader is deleted rather than left
unwired.

### Added — a per-agent drive-surface table

Both bugs above are the same mistake: validating against a surface the bridge
does not drive. `docs/agents.md` now records, per agent, **which** headless
surface is driven, its transport/framing, and whether usage is reported on it —
with the two cases where the CLI reports usage *somewhere else* called out
explicitly. It also states plainly that every model list is discovered live
except **Claude Code's**, which is the one curated, hand-maintained list.


## [0.0.17-alpha.20260805] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed — Codex's context meter works: usage is not on `turn/completed`

Codex had usage-parsing code all along, and it read a field that does not
exist. Probed against a **live `codex app-server`** (the surface the adapter
actually drives), a completed turn carries only
`{ id, items, itemsView, status, error, startedAt, completedAt, durationMs }` —
no `tokenUsage`. Usage arrives on its own notification:

```
thread/tokenUsage/updated { threadId, turnId, tokenUsage: {
  total: { totalTokens, inputTokens, cachedInputTokens, outputTokens,
           reasoningOutputTokens }, last: {…}, modelContextWindow } }
```

The adapter now listens for it and carries the numbers to the turn's
completion. `total` is used, not `last`: the meter shows the **thread's**
cumulative context, not the newest turn's slice. `modelContextWindow` rides on
the same notification, so the window no longer depends on a `models_cache.json`
lookup that could miss the model — that stays only as a fallback.

The old parser read the **rollout file's** snake_case shape
(`input_tokens`, …), which the app-server never sends; it now reads the real
one, and the test that asserted the old shape is rewritten rather than deleted.

### Fixed — Zero reports its token usage, from its own session store

Zero's ACP stream genuinely carries no usage — but Zero records one itself,
appending a `provider_usage` event per turn to
`<XDG_DATA_HOME|~/.local/share>/zero/sessions/<sessionId>/events.jsonl`.
Captured from a real run against a live Zero: `{ promptTokens,
completionTokens, totalTokens, cachedInputTokens, reasoningTokens }`.

The adapter now reads the **last** such event when a turn completes (an earlier
one under-reports a context that has grown) and uses `totalTokens`, falling back
to prompt + completion. `cachedInputTokens` is a subset of `promptTokens` and is
never added, or the meter would read high. The context window comes from Zero's
model registry, which already carries it.

Best-effort by contract: an unreadable or absent store means the turn completes
without usage, never that it fails.

### Fixed — Grok reports its token usage, so context and stats work for it

Grok was the only wired agent reporting no usage at all, which left the phone
with no context indicator and no consumption stats for it. Two causes, both
found by running the real CLI against a local sink and reading its own ACP
transcript:

- **Its stream arrives on two methods.** The adapter accepted only
  `session/update`, but Grok emits `turn_completed` — the update that carries
  the usage block — on **`_x.ai/session/update`**. Every usage report was
  dropped before it was ever parsed.
- **The capability said it had none.** `reportsContextUsage` was `false` with a
  `FOR-DEV` noting it was unverified because the account was balance-blocked.
  It reports a full block: `{ inputTokens, outputTokens, totalTokens,
  cachedReadTokens, reasoningTokens }`.

`totalTokens` is used as the turn's size, falling back to input + output.
`cachedReadTokens` is a subset of `inputTokens` (as in Codex's
`cached_input_tokens`) and is not added, or it would double-count. The context
window comes from the model cache, which already carries Grok's own
`totalContextTokens` from the ACP handshake.


## [0.0.16-alpha.20260804] - 2026-08-04

### Added — the bridge names a conversation instead of reusing its first words

A thread was named after the first ~72 characters of its opening message, so
two conversations that start with the same phrase are indistinguishable in the
list. **No agent CLI can help here**: every one of them leaves titling to its
own client, and the headless protocols uxnan drives expose no title — a thread
uxnan creates comes back from `codex thread/list` with `name: null`, a fresh
OpenCode session stays `"New session - <timestamp>"`, and Claude's session name
is derived from the folder, not the content. uxnan is the client, so it names
its own conversations, exactly as their desktop clients do.

- Two stages, so a thread is never nameless and never stuck with a weak name:
  the opening message still titles it instantly (`provisionalTitle`), and once
  the first turn has an answer to summarize the agent writes a real one.
- `IAgentAdapter.generateTitle` is a **side errand, not a turn** — a fresh
  one-shot with **no session id**, so nothing enters the thread's history, no
  streaming event fires and the agent's context is untouched. It runs on the
  agent's *cheapest* model (Claude: `haiku`), never the conversation's own.
- Entirely best-effort and bounded (30s): no credit, a missing CLI or a timeout
  leaves the provisional title in place and never disturbs the thread.
- `ThreadStore.applyGeneratedTitle` refuses to overwrite a `user` title, so a
  rename made while the turn was running always wins over the generated name.
  `stream/thread/renamed` then converges every connected client.
- `thread/rename` gained `source`; absent still means the user renamed it.

Verified against the real cheap model through the adapter: two conversations
opening with the **identical** phrase ("Hola, quiero que me ayudes con una cosa
del proyecto") were named *"Corregir expiración JWT en login"* and *"Despliegue
automático a Cloudflare Pages"* — the exact collision this replaces — each in
the user's own language, in ~5-7s.
- **Every active agent names conversations**, each through its own CLI's
  one-shot form, and each chosen so the errand leaves no trace in the
  conversation it names:
  - **Claude Code** — `-p` with no `--resume`, on `haiku`.
  - **Codex** — `codex exec --ephemeral -s read-only --skip-git-repo-check
    -o <file>` on `gpt-5.4-mini`. Three flags carry the guarantee: `--ephemeral`
    persists no session, `read-only` denies the sandbox any write, and `-o`
    yields the final message **alone** (stdout carries a banner, hook lines and
    a token count, so parsing it would be guesswork).
  - **pi** — `pi -p --no-session`. **OpenCode** — `opencode run` with no
    `--session`/`--continue`. **Antigravity** — `agy -p` with no
    `--conversation`. **Grok** — `grok -p`. **Zero** — `zero exec`.
- Model ids were **verified against each account's real list**, not assumed: a
  wrong id is not cosmetic, the CLI rejects the run. OpenCode, pi and Grok route
  through many providers and so have no fixed cheap tier — they title on their
  own default (tracked in `FOR-DEV.md`).

Tests: 7 new (`test/agents/thread-title.test.ts`) covering the provisional
title, the prompt, and reducing a CLI's decorated output to a bare title.
### Added — a queued follow-up can reach the agent without waiting for the turn

A message sent while an agent worked has always waited for the whole turn to
end. The CLIs do not work that way: they take what you type at the next tool
boundary, inside the running turn, which is what makes it possible to correct
an agent's course without stopping it. The bridge now does the same wherever
the agent's CLI actually allows it.

- `AgentManager` hands a just-queued turn to the running one through the new
  optional `IAgentAdapter.steerTurn`, then marks it `delivered` (linked to the
  turn it joined) and emits `stream/turn/delivered`. `turn/send` answers
  `{ delivered: true }` instead of `{ queued: true }`.
- The hand-off is deliberately narrow, so a thread's order can never be
  rearranged: only when the adapter advertises `steering`, a turn is really in
  flight, the queue is **empty** (anything already waiting was sent first) and
  **not paused** (the queue pauses precisely because the user stopped the agent
  or it broke — pushing more at it then is the one outcome nobody wants).
- Every refusal falls back to the queue that shipped before: a `false` return, a
  thrown transport error, or a turn that ended mid-hand-off all leave the
  message `queued`, so it costs a wait and nothing else.
- `ThreadStore.deliverQueuedTurn` persists the new terminal status. A delivered
  turn is not `cancelled` — the message *did* reach the agent — so `queue/clear`
  leaves it alone and the drain path never replays it as a turn of its own.
- Turn text resolution (a `/command` expansion, an image attachment
  materialized into the workspace) is now shared by both paths, so a steered
  message behaves identically to one that waited. The attachment temp dir is
  keyed to the **running** turn, which is the one whose completion sweeps it.
- `bridge/status` advertises `features.midTurnDelivery`, so a client asks rather
  than inferring it from a version.

Tests: 9 new (`test/agents/agent-midturn-delivery.test.ts`) covering the
hand-off, the no-replay guarantee, a non-steering agent's unchanged behaviour,
a decline, a throw, queue ordering, a paused queue, an idle thread and
`queue/clear`.

### Changed — Claude Code takes its prompt on stdin, and follow-ups mid-turn

- The Claude adapter now runs `claude -p --input-format stream-json …` and
  writes the prompt as a stream-json user message instead of passing it as an
  argv element. That open pipe is the input channel `steerTurn` writes into, so
  a follow-up reaches the agent at its next tool boundary rather than waiting
  for the whole turn. The spawn is still `shell:false`, so the prompt is no
  closer to a shell than before, and `--resume` continuity is unchanged
  (verified: turn 2 of a probe recalled a number given in turn 1, same session
  id, deltas still streaming).
- **The pipe must be closed for the turn to end.** In this mode the CLI waits
  for another message after emitting `result` instead of exiting, so the
  adapter closes stdin at every terminal path — completion, error, and the
  background-task case, where the turn is held open for work the model left
  running and the pipe now closes once the last task resolves.
- A follow-up is refused (not written) once the turn has produced its result:
  the CLI would read a late write as a NEW turn and stream a second reply into
  a turn the bridge already closed.
- `SpawnedProcess` gained an optional `stdin` and `SpawnExtra` a `stdin:'pipe'`
  opt-in. The default stays `'ignore'` — the one-shot CLIs hang on an open pipe.

Verified end-to-end against the real `claude` 2.1.220 driving the built
adapter: a message steered 7s into a five-`sleep` turn was taken after the
first tool returned, the remaining sleeps were abandoned, and the run produced
one `turn_started` and one `turn_completed`, every event on the original turn.
Tests: 5 new in `test/adapters/claude-adapter.test.ts`.

### Added — OpenCode takes a follow-up into the turn it is already running

- `OpenCodeAdapter.steerTurn` sends another `prompt_async` on the SAME session
  while the server is busy. No second `ActiveRun` is created on purpose: events
  route by session, so the extra assistant message the server opens for the
  answer already folds into the running turn — registering a second run would
  instead retire the first as stale and split the reply in two.
- The running turn's model and variant stay in force; a message *inside* a turn
  must not switch models mid-answer.
- If the turn goes idle while the prompt round-trip is in flight, it still
  counts as **delivered**: the server accepted the message, so it is at the
  agent. Answering "not taken" would make the bridge queue it and send the same
  text a second time, and an instruction acted on twice is worse than a reply
  the bridge could not attribute.

Verified end-to-end against the real `opencode` 1.18.11 driving the built
adapter: a message steered 6s into a five-`sleep` turn was taken after the
first tool returned, the remaining sleeps were abandoned, and the run produced
one `turn_started` and one `turn_completed`, every event on the original turn.
Tests: 5 new in `test/adapters/opencode-adapter.test.ts`.

### Added — Codex steers a running turn through the app-server's `turn/steer`

- `CodexAdapter.steerTurn` calls `turn/steer { threadId, expectedTurnId, input }`
  — the app-server's own mid-turn follow-up, the protocol equivalent of
  pressing Enter (rather than Tab) on a message in the Codex TUI.
- `expectedTurnId` is a precondition the app-server enforces: it rejects the
  request when that turn is no longer active, so the race we would otherwise
  have to guess at is decided by the server. A rejection is reported as "not
  taken", never as an error, and the message stays queued.

**Not yet verified against a live Codex turn.** Implemented and unit-tested
against the published protocol schema (`codex app-server generate-json-schema`,
codex-cli 0.146.0), but the account's weekly limit was exhausted (0 credits)
when this landed, so no real turn could be steered. Tracked in
`bridge/FOR-DEV.md`; run the probe once credits return.
Tests: 4 new in `test/adapters/codex-adapter.test.ts`.

### Changed — pi runs in `--mode rpc`, and takes follow-ups mid-turn

- The pi adapter now spawns `pi --mode rpc` instead of `pi -p --mode json`, and
  sends the prompt as an RPC command on stdin rather than as an argv element.
  Print mode reads **all** of stdin as the initial prompt, so it has no input
  channel while it works; RPC mode has a first-class `steer` command, drained by
  pi's agent loop at its next boundary. Both modes emit the identical
  `AgentSessionEvent` JSON lines, so the whole event-parsing path is unchanged.
- As with Claude, **the pipe must be closed for the turn to end**: in RPC mode pi
  waits for the next command and only exits when stdin ends.
- `parsePiLine` now understands RPC command acknowledgements. A *failed*
  `prompt` response ends the turn with its error (the agent never started, so
  nothing else is coming); a failed `steer` deliberately does **not** — the
  follow-up did not land, but the turn is fine, and the manager already treats
  a refusal as "leave it queued".

Verified end-to-end against the real `pi` 0.81.1 driving the built adapter: a
message steered 7s into a five-`sleep` turn was taken after the first tool
returned, the remaining sleeps were abandoned, and the run produced one
`turn_started` and one `turn_completed`, every event on the original turn.
Tests: 5 new in `test/adapters/pi-adapter.test.ts`. Bridge suite
**625 passing**.

## [0.0.15-alpha.20260803] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed — the published package pins the matching `@uxnan/shared`

`0.0.14-alpha.20260803` was published pinning `@uxnan/shared@0.0.11-alpha.20260729`:
its release workflow reads the `latest` dist-tag at build time, and both tags were
pushed together, so it resolved shared **before** `0.0.12-alpha.20260803` was on npm.
That shared build knows 68 methods, so an install of `0.0.14` would have answered
`workspace/resolveFileLink` — the file-link resolution this cycle adds — with
"method not found", since `HandlerRouter` validates every request against
`isKnownMethod` from the shared registry.

No bridge source changed between `0.0.14` and `0.0.15`; this release only carries
the correct `@uxnan/shared@0.0.12-alpha.20260803` pin. Push a `shared-v*` tag and
let it publish **before** pushing `bridge-v*`.

## [0.0.14-alpha.20260803] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed — a turn no longer ends while the agent is still working

An agent that says *"I left that running, I'll report back"* was being reported
to the phone as finished. Verified against the real `claude` CLI, timed: it
emits its end-of-turn `result` and **keeps running**, and when the background
work finishes in time it **wakes the model** and produces a second, complete
turn on the same process. The bridge was ending the turn at the first `result`.

- **Background tasks are now tracked, so a `result` with live work does not end
  the turn.** `system` stream lines are no longer all parsed as `init`: a
  `task_started` / `task_notification` pair is recognized, and while a task is
  live the completion is held until the CLI produces its follow-up turn or
  exits. One `turn_completed` per turn, carrying **both** replies — the CLI's
  `result` only ever holds the latest turn's text, so the first reply survived
  only in the accumulated narration.
- **Work the CLI killed is reported instead of passing as a clean success.**
  The CLI gives background work only a few seconds' grace after the turn ends
  and then kills it (`status:"stopped"`) — measured at ~4–6 s, with the work
  genuinely lost. The turn now carries a warning block saying the agent left
  work running and it was interrupted, rather than the phone showing a clean
  finish over lost work. A task still open when the process exits counts the
  same way.
- **A turn that has ended stays ended** (`ThreadStore`). `appendDelta`,
  `appendThinking`, `appendBlock` and `completeTurn` now ignore a turn in a
  terminal status instead of mutating it: a second completion could previously
  **overwrite the reply the user had already read**, and late output landed on a
  closed turn. This guard is adapter-agnostic on purpose — every adapter except
  Antigravity ends its turn on a protocol event while its CLI keeps running, so
  late output is reachable for all of them.
- **The message queue is not drained twice** (`AgentManager`). A duplicate
  terminal event would have started the next queued turn against a CLI that was
  still running — the exact serialization the queue exists to enforce.

New `warningBlock` content block (`kind:'warning'`, the `SystemContent` shape the
phone already renders); no wire contract changed, so no client update is needed.

### Added — safe cross-worktree file-link resolution

- Added `workspace/resolveFileLink { cwd, href }`, which canonicalizes a local
  path cited by an agent and returns the `cwd + relative path` pair consumed by
  Mobile's existing file viewer.
- Relative links resolve from the conversation cwd. Absolute paths, `file:`
  URLs and `..` references may target another worktree; the target's Git root
  becomes the viewer root, with a narrow containing-directory fallback for
  non-Git files.
- The resolver requires an existing regular file and rejects remote schemes,
  `.git` internals and sensitive path segments. Percent-encoded paths,
  fragments and common `:line[:column]` citations are normalized.
- `path-guard` now rejects a sensitive name in **any** segment below a
  workspace root, not just the file's own name, so a read can no longer reach
  into a `.env/` directory. Segments above the root are left alone: the user
  chose that root, and judging its ancestors would deny every read of a project
  that merely lives under a matching folder name.

### Added — native-session turns converge back into Uxnan

- `turn/list` now reconciles the agent-owned transcript on every idle read,
  even when the bridge already has stored turns. Completed prompts and answers
  written from Codex Desktop/CLI, OpenCode Desktop, Claude Code, pi, Zero or
  Grok therefore join the same Uxnan thread without duplicating bridge-owned
  turns or replacing their richer segments, queue state or usage.
- Codex, Claude and pi use their persisted JSONL transcripts. OpenCode reads
  the official `opencode serve` session-message endpoint (with its legacy JSON
  store as a compatibility fallback). Zero reads `events.jsonl`; Grok rebuilds
  only ACP turns closed by `turn_completed` from `updates.jsonl`.
- Native-only turns receive deterministic ids and are refreshed additively on
  later reads. Missing native history never deletes bridge history, and a
  native transcript is not consulted while that bridge thread has a live turn.
- Antigravity remains explicitly unsupported for cross-client history: its
  conversation database stores opaque payloads and `agy` exposes no reliable
  history/export command, so the bridge does not guess.

### Fixed — terminal events can no longer erase earlier agent responses

- Codex now accumulates every `agentMessage` item instead of replacing the turn
  with the last item at `turn/completed`. Its native `commentary` and
  `final_answer` phases are persisted as response boundaries.
- Claude Code and Pi now reconcile each native assistant-message envelope
  independently, including envelopes that did not stream deltas, and persist
  their boundaries. Agents whose protocols expose one accumulated response
  continue unchanged.
- `ThreadStore.completeTurn` is lossless for every adapter: a terminal text may
  extend or repeat streamed prose, but a divergent last-message payload is
  appended as another response and never deletes text already shown to a user.

### Added — durable context-compaction events

- Codex `item/completed { type:'contextCompaction' }`, Claude Code
  `system/compact_boundary`, OpenCode `session.compacted`, and pi's successful
  `compaction_end` now become structured `compaction` content blocks. They use
  the normal persisted block/segment path, so the marker survives reconnects
  and `turn/list` reconciliation in the same position seen live.
- Pi and Claude preserve their reported reason/token metadata. Codex and
  OpenCode report a marker with `reason:'unknown'` because their event does not
  carry a trustworthy cause. Zero/Grok's ACP updates and Antigravity's text-only
  one-shot output expose no compaction event, so the bridge deliberately emits
  nothing for them.
- The four truthful integrations advertise `reportsCompaction:true`.

### Changed — Gemini CLI is now non-runnable legacy

- `agent/list` retains Gemini only as `deprecated:true, available:false` for
  legacy inspection. `AgentManager` rejects new turns and returns no models or
  commands for deprecated adapters. Antigravity remains the supported Google
  agent.

### Changed — reliable PDF delivery for the mobile workspace viewer

- `workspace/readFile` now identifies `.pdf` files by extension and returns
  their original bytes as base64. Previously, a PDF whose first 8,000 bytes had
  no NUL could be decoded as UTF-8 and corrupted before it reached the phone.
- PDF reads have a separate, bounded 20 MiB ceiling; the existing 5 MiB text
  and 10 MiB image limits are unchanged. The workspace path guard and
  sensitive-file exclusions still run before every read.
- Added a bridge regression proving that a text-looking PDF prefix round-trips
  byte-for-byte.

## [0.0.13-alpha.20260729] - 2026-07-29

### Added — a per-thread message queue (and the serialization hole it closes)

The agent CLIs let you type a follow-up while they work and hold it for the
current turn. The bridge now does the same for the phone — and doing so fixes a
real hole: **`AgentManager.sendTurn` never checked whether a turn was already in
flight.** It overwrote `#activeTurnByThread` and started the second turn on top
of the first. OpenCode's adapter retired the earlier run (leaving it hanging on
the phone forever); Claude Code, Gemini, pi and Antigravity run one-shot per
turn, so it meant two CLI processes on the same `--resume` session. Only the UI
refusing to send a second message kept it from happening.

- **Queue instead of clobber.** A `turn/send` that arrives with a turn in flight
  — or with a non-empty queue, even a paused one, since jumping ahead of
  messages sent earlier would run them out of order — is persisted as a turn
  with the new `queued` status and parked. It drains automatically on
  `turn_completed`, taking the identical command/attachment/adapter path a
  normal turn takes.
- **Run options are frozen at queue time** (model, effort, access mode,
  attachments): a follow-up runs the way it looked when it was written, not the
  way the thread is configured minutes later.
- **The queue holds after a stop or a failure** (`turnAborted` / `turnError`)
  rather than firing the follow-ups at an agent the user just stopped or that
  just broke. `queue/resume` and `queue/clear` are the two ways out.
- **`turn/cancel` on a queued turn** never reaches an adapter: the turn leaves
  the queue and is marked `cancelled` — kept in the thread, not deleted, so the
  user's message stays visible with its mark. `cancelled` is deliberately
  distinct from `aborted` (never ran vs. interrupted mid-flight).
- **Capped at 10** queued turns per thread; `queue: false` opts out of queueing
  and gets `AgentBusy` (`-32009`) instead.
- **`turn/list`** now reports `queuedTurnIds` / `queuePaused` /
  `queuePausedReason` alongside `activeTurnId`, and every change broadcasts
  `stream/queue/updated` (whole state, not a delta) plus
  `stream/turn/cancelled`.
- **Startup cleanup.** The queue is live state and does not survive a restart
  (neither does the turn it was waiting behind), so
  `ThreadStore.cancelOrphanedQueuedTurns()` closes out any turn left `queued` on
  disk as `cancelled` instead of stranding it.
- `ThreadStore` gains `queueTurn` / `beginQueuedTurn` / `cancelQueuedTurn` /
  `queuedTurnIds`, and `#setTurnStatus` only stamps `completedAt` for a terminal
  status (promoting `queued` → `streaming` is a turn starting, not ending).
- **`bridge/status` now advertises `features.messageQueue`**, so a client can
  ask whether this bridge can queue instead of comparing version strings. A
  client that guesses wrong makes an older bridge start a second concurrent turn
  and kill the running one — which is exactly what a pre-queue bridge did when a
  newer app offered the action.
- 14 new tests (560 total). Spec: `architecture/02a` §5.8.13, `02b` §1.2–1.4.

### Fixed — an attachment on a `cwd`-less turn was written where no agent could read it

- `materializeAttachments` fell back to the **OS temp dir** (with an absolute
  reference) whenever `turn/send` carried no `cwd`. Every agent is confined to
  its workspace, so the file was simply unreachable — verified against the real
  CLI: Claude answers *"the read was blocked by a permission prompt"* for the
  very same image under the temp dir, while it describes it correctly from a
  workspace-relative path.
- The fallback is now the **adapter's own working directory**, which is where
  the CLI actually runs. A new optional `IAgentAdapter.defaultCwd()`
  (implemented by all eight adapters) reports it, so the reference stays
  workspace-relative and inside the sandbox. The temp dir remains a last resort
  for an adapter that reports none.

### Fixed — Zero receives an attachment as a real image, not a path it can't read

- Zero's `read_file` tool is line-oriented **text**, so the bridge's file-path
  delivery had it read a PNG as garbage — while its ACP advertises
  `promptCapabilities.image` and decodes an inline `{ type: "image", mimeType,
  data }` block straight into the model's image input.
- The Zero adapter now sends attachments **natively** as inline ACP image
  blocks. New optional `IAgentAdapter.handlesAttachments()` lets an adapter say
  it delivers attachments itself, and the bridge then writes no file and appends
  no path note for it (pointing a text reader at a binary is worse than saying
  nothing). Every other adapter keeps the CLI-agnostic file path.
- Covered by unit tests (the emitted prompt blocks, an image-only turn, and the
  manager skipping materialization); **not yet exercised end to end** — the
  local Zero account is credit-blocked.

### Fixed — Antigravity and Grok now accept image attachments

- Both declared `capabilities.images: false`, so the phone hid the "+" attach
  action for them entirely. Verified against the real CLIs with a four-quadrant
  probe image, which **both described correctly**: `agy` opens a workspace file
  with its own tools (its models are the multimodal Gemini family), and Grok
  does the same — its ACP `promptCapabilities.image: false` only rules out an
  *inline* image block on `session/prompt`, which is not how the bridge delivers
  an attachment. Both are now `images: true`.
- Whether the *model* sees pixels or reasons about the bytes with tools is the
  model's business (a non-multimodal OpenCode model still answers — it inspects
  the file), now documented per agent in `docs/agents.md` → *Image attachments*,
  alongside the delivery rules (spec: `architecture/02a` §5.8.12).

## [0.0.12-alpha.20260724] - 2026-07-24

### Added — Claude Opus 5 in the built-in Claude Code model list

- `DEFAULT_DAEMON_CONFIG` now seeds `claude-opus-5` ("Opus 5") among the pinned
  concrete Claude Code versions, right after Fable 5. Claude Code has no
  enumerate command, so this curated seed is the only way a concrete version
  reaches the phone's model picker (the `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` aliases stay the
  moving "latest" entries). Because the seed is a live baseline unioned in at
  load time, existing `~/.uxnan/daemon-config.json` installs pick it up with no
  edit. `claudeContextWindow` already reports 1M tokens for any `opus` id, so the
  phone's context-usage indicator shows a percentage for it out of the box.
- `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-5` and `claude-sonnet-4-5` are seeded too:
  every concrete model the installed `claude` CLI still accepts and that the
  account can reasonably pick, ten in total. Invitation-only models
  (`claude-mythos-*`), date-suffixed snapshots and routing variants
  (`…[1m]`, `…-fast`) are deliberately excluded, and a test now enforces that.
  The bridge list and the desktop app's hand-kept twin
  (`uxnandesktop/src-tauri/src/agentcli.rs` `CLAUDE_MODELS`) hold exactly the
  same ten models in the same order.

### Added — the `fable` "latest" alias was missing from the picker

- `CLAUDE_MODEL_ALIASES` now advertises **`fable`** alongside `opus`/`sonnet`/
  `haiku`, shown as `Fable (latest)`. `claude --help` (2.1.x) documents `fable`
  as a valid `--model` alias, so the phone was missing the only auto-updating
  entry for the top tier — Fable was selectable solely as a pinned version.
  Aliases are ordered most capable first and are still flagged `isLatestAlias`,
  so the phone's "show latest models" toggle hides all four together.

### Changed — the curated Claude model list is documented as a two-place edit

- `docs/agents.md` gains a *"Maintaining the built-in list — it has a twin in the
  desktop app"* section: a table naming both hand-kept lists and what each one
  feeds, the id rules (canonical ids only — no date suffixes, no `…[1m]`/`…-fast`
  routing variants, no bare aliases), and a note that a model in an existing tier
  needs no `claudeContextWindow` edit. The seed's own comment in
  `src/daemon-config.ts` now points at the desktop twin as well.

## [0.0.11-alpha.20260721] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed — LAN discovery now works on multi-homed Windows hosts

- The dependency-free mDNS advertiser now joins `224.0.0.251:5353` explicitly
  on every eligible advertised IPv4 and sends each announcement/response once
  through every successfully joined interface. Previously it called
  `addMembership()` without an interface and never set the outbound multicast
  interface, so Windows could choose a lower-metric disconnected Ethernet,
  Tailscale, Hyper-V or WSL route instead of the Wi-Fi shared with the phone.
  Direct TCP pairing still worked while Android sent `_uxnan._tcp.local`
  queries forever with no answer.
- Startup logs now name the IPv4 interfaces used for mDNS and report individual
  membership/send failures, making UDP 5353 routing/firewall faults observable
  without logging any pairing secret. The fallback remains QR or a typed host.
- Security is unchanged: mDNS advertises only untrusted discovery hints
  (display name, bridge id, address and port), never the pairing code. Choosing
  a result only fills one host field; the user must still enter the code, that
  code is sent only to the chosen host, and trust is created only after the
  operator-gated E2EE bootstrap.

### Changed — profile activity is retained in a complete durable ledger

- `~/.uxnan/metrics.json` is now a version-2 global ledger for conversations,
  turn message/day buckets, reported tokens, connection sessions and mutating
  Git actions. Thread creation/turn usage is projected incrementally and an
  idempotent startup/read/export backfill migrates existing `threads.json` data.
- Deleting a thread no longer subtracts its conversations, messages or tokens
  from `metrics/get`. The mutable conversation store and historical activity
  ledger now have intentionally different retention semantics.
- `metrics/export` and `metrics/import` now seal and merge the complete ledger,
  so a same-PC restore recovers conversations, messages and token activity as
  well as sessions and Git work. Legacy version-1 backups remain importable.
- Ledger writes remain atomic and now retain five rotating local generations
  (`metrics.json.bak1` … `.bak5`); reads automatically recover from the newest
  available generation if the primary file is missing or malformed.

## [0.0.10-alpha.20260721] - 2026-07-21

### Changed — `start` always re-checks for a new bridge version
- `uxnan-bridge start` now bypasses the 24h update-check cache (`ttlMs: 0`).
  Reported after 0.0.9 shipped: a bridge that had checked while 0.0.8 was newest
  stayed silent for up to a day, so the operator never learned an update existed
  and kept pairing a version-incompatible pair. Short-lived commands
  (`status`/`qr`/`code`) keep using the cache so they stay fast.

### Added — `/pair/resolve` now logs its outcome
- The manual-pairing endpoint logs accepted / rejected / rate-limited per client
  IP (**never the code — it is a shared secret**). Without it, a request that
  never arrived and a request that was rejected looked identical in the bridge
  log, which is exactly how a Tailscale connect-timeout was misdiagnosed as a
  bad pairing code.

### Fixed — a refused atomic write could hang a turn forever (Windows)
- **`DaemonState.writeJson` now retries the `rename`.** Renaming over an existing
  file is intermittently refused on Windows with `EPERM` (also `EBUSY`/`EACCES`)
  when anything holds a momentary handle on the target — antivirus, the Search
  indexer, a backup agent. POSIX `rename` has no such window, which is why this
  only ever bit on Windows. The write itself was fine; only the swap was refused.
  A short capped backoff (5/15/40/100/250 ms, ~410 ms worst case) turns the
  spurious failure into a successful write; a non-transient error (e.g. `ENOSPC`)
  still surfaces immediately, and the temp sibling is cleaned up either way.
- **Why it mattered beyond a flaky test.** `ThreadStore` persists every streamed
  turn through `writeJson`, and `AgentManager` swallows event-handling errors, so
  a single refused rename on the `turn_completed` write left the turn stuck at
  `streaming` **forever** — the phone sat on "responding…" until the app was
  killed. It is also the long-standing "Windows CI flake": the bridge suite would
  burn its full 120 s `waitFor` budget on a different test each run, and it
  reddened `main` and a release run during the 0.0.9 cycle. Reproduced locally,
  root-caused from the actual `EPERM` stack, and the previously-hanging file now
  passes 3/3 consecutive runs (full suite 535/535).
- **Defense in depth:** if a terminal event (`turn_completed`/`turn_error`/
  `turn_aborted`) still throws, `AgentManager` now fails the turn and notifies the
  phone instead of leaving it `streaming` — a visible error beats a silent hang.
- `renameWithRetry` is exported with an injectable rename so the retry policy is
  unit-tested without provoking a real `EPERM`.

## [0.0.9-alpha.20260720] - 2026-07-20

### Security
- **Authenticate the E2EE envelope's `sessionId`/`seq`/direction as AES-GCM AAD**, closing a gap where replay protection relied entirely on the unauthenticated `seq` field: a malicious relay or on-path attacker could bump a captured envelope's `seq` to re-trigger a non-idempotent handler, wedge the channel with an out-of-range `seq`, or reflect a bridge→phone envelope back as if it were inbound phone traffic (the same session key is used both directions with no prior direction binding). `bridge/src/transport/crypto.ts`'s `aesGcmEncrypt`/`aesGcmDecrypt` now accept an optional `aad` (mirroring the existing `metrics-seal.ts` pattern); `bridge/src/transport/secure-channel.ts` adds `buildEnvelopeAad(sessionId, seq, direction)` and binds it on every seal/decrypt, so tampering `seq` or reflecting a message from the other direction now fails the GCM tag instead of silently passing the old unauthenticated `seq <= lastInboundSeq` check. Nonce generation and HKDF session-key derivation are unchanged. Ships together with the matching `uxnanmobile` change (see its CHANGELOG) — envelopes are not wire-compatible across the version gap.
- **Enforce `SECURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` in the handshake (now `2`).** Both sides
  already exchanged `protocolVersion` in `clientHello`/`serverHello` but neither
  validated it, so the AAD change above would have failed as a **silent hang**:
  the handshake is untouched, so pairing/reconnect completes and both ends report
  "connected", after which the bridge drops every phone request in
  `session-handler.ts`'s bare `catch { continue; }` and the phone's RPC
  correlator never resolves — every action just times out with nothing to
  diagnose. `server-handshake.ts` now rejects a `clientHello` whose
  `protocolVersion` differs, before any key derivation or trust mutation, with a
  message naming both versions. Covered by a new test asserting the rejection
  *and* that nothing was trusted on the way.
- **Gate the LAN `qr_bootstrap` handshake on an operator-armed pairing window.**
  Previously, the direct-LAN/Tailscale server accepted a first-time (`qr_bootstrap`)
  handshake unconditionally: it verified only the phone's own transcript
  signature (an attacker signs that with their own key) and then trusted the
  identity, with no check that the operator had actually opened a pairing
  window. Since the LAN server binds all interfaces (intentional, for
  Tailscale), any reachable LAN/Tailscale peer could self-enroll as a trusted
  device and drive `turn/send` and other handlers. Now `PairingCodeService`
  exposes an `arm()`/`isArmed()` pairing window (3-minute TTL, in-memory), and
  `server-handshake.ts` rejects a `qr_bootstrap` outside the window, before any
  `trustStore` mutation and before `ready` is sent. Three operator actions arm
  it: showing the QR (`generatePairingQr`), showing the manual code
  (`currentPairingCode`), and a **successful `GET /pair/resolve`** — a caller
  that produces the current code proved it read the code off the PC, which is
  the same consent signal (and the only one that reaches a hidden daemon, since
  `qr`/`code` run in a separate process and share the code through disk while
  arming stays in-memory). So pairing keeps working exactly as before, including
  against an autostarted, console-less daemon and at any time after start —
  what changed is that a peer which never saw the PC screen is now refused.
  `trusted_reconnect` is unaffected — an already-trusted phone reconnects with
  no arming required. The relay path is unaffected too (it already scopes
  bootstrap to one `expectedSessionId` per connection). Two follow-ups are
  tracked in `FOR-DEV.md`: binding the proof to *this* phone rather than to
  *some* open window (needs coordinated mobile work), and arming a hidden daemon
  for the QR-**scan** path (a scanned QR never calls `/pair/resolve`; pair with
  the manual code there).
- Bound the pairing-code service's per-IP rate-limit map (`PairingCodeService`
  `#rate`) against unbounded memory growth from IP rotation — trivial over an
  allocated IPv6 /64 — which previously grew the map by one entry per new
  source address forever, turning the anti-brute-force control into a memory
  sink. `rateLimited` now sweeps expired entries whenever it opens a new window
  for an IP, and enforces a hard `rateMaxKeys` cap (default 10,000; oldest
  entry evicted first) as a backstop against a burst of still-unexpired IPs. A
  single IP's own throttling budget is unaffected. Covered by 3 new tests in
  `test/pairing/pairing-code-service.test.ts` (single-IP throttling preserved,
  the map never exceeds `rateMaxKeys`, expired entries are swept instead of
  accumulating).

### Fixed
- Back off the relay reconnect loop when a session ends almost immediately
  (relay accept-then-close, a bounce, or the session already being taken).
  Previously only a `dial()` rejection was delayed (`RELAY_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS`);
  an accepted-then-closed session re-dialed with zero delay, so a bouncing relay
  could drive the bridge into a tight, CPU-spinning reconnect loop. The loop now
  applies a capped exponential backoff (`nextRelayBackoff` in `src/bridge.ts`,
  base 2s / cap 30s) after any session shorter than 3s, and resets to the base
  delay once a session actually carries a phone. Covered by
  `test/transport/relay-backoff.test.ts` (5 tests).

### Tests
- Add direct unit tests for the workspace path-traversal guard (`resolveWithinRoot` / `isSensitiveName` in `src/workspace/path-guard.ts`), covering every escape branch (parent, multi-level, absolute-outside-root), the `.git` rejection (leading and nested segment) and every `SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` entry — previously only one traversal case was exercised, and only indirectly through a handler test.

## [0.0.8-alpha.20260719] - 2026-07-19

### Added — Antigravity (`agy`) wired as the 8th real agent
- Wired **Antigravity**, Google's `agy` CLI (the successor to the deprecated
  standalone Gemini CLI; its models are the Gemini family), as a real one-shot
  per-turn adapter (`adapters/antigravity-adapter.ts` +
  `adapters/resolve-antigravity.ts`, registered in `startBridge`). Validated live
  against `agy` 1.1.4 — the thin-`-p` blockers that had it deferred (no `--model`,
  no output to a piped stdout, no session id) are resolved:
  - each turn spawns `agy --conversation <uuid> --add-dir <cwd>
    (--dangerously-skip-permissions | --mode plan) [--model "<label>"] -p <text>`
    and streams the plain-text stdout as `delta`s + a `turn/completed`;
  - **continuity** via a client-owned `--conversation <uuid>` — it CREATES the
    conversation on the first turn and RESUMES it after, so no log parsing;
  - **workspace targeting** via `--add-dir <cwd>` (`agy` has no `-C/--cwd`, and
    without it edits a private scratch dir instead of the project);
  - **permission posture** from the thread `accessMode`: `approveForMe`/
    `fullAccess` → `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (autonomous — the only posture
    under which headless `agy` can edit at all), `requestApproval` → read-only
    `--mode plan` (`agy -p` cannot prompt for approval, so "ask me first" safely
    degrades to plan-only);
  - **model discovery** via `agy models` (`listModels`); capabilities advertise
    `planMode` + `streaming` + `autonomous` (no interactive approvals, no per-turn
    token usage). Auth falls back to binary availability (like the Gemini adapter).
- 11 new adapter unit tests (bridge suite now **493**, on top of the session-recovery
  fix's +7).

### Fixed — parallel subagent activity no longer corrupts the text↔work-log order
- **Claude Code subagent (Task) events are now recognized and ordered correctly.**
  With parallel subagents, `claude --output-format stream-json` interleaves the
  subagent's `assistant`/`user` lines (marked `parent_tool_use_id`) with the main
  loop's partial text deltas. The adapter treated them as main-loop events, so a
  subagent tool result landing mid-delta severed the open text run — the stored
  `Message.segments` (and the live phone view) rendered the sentence **split
  mid-word by a Work-log card** (verified against a real session: 3 mid-word cuts
  in one 355-segment turn). Now (`claude-adapter.ts`):
  - the parser surfaces `parent_tool_use_id` plus `content_block_start/stop`
    boundaries, and the adapter tracks whether a MAIN text run is open;
  - a block emitted while the run is open is flagged **`beforeText`** — the store
    (`thread-store.appendBlock`) and the `stream/content/block` notification both
    slot it BEFORE the open run, so the run is never severed and live/re-sync
    order match; sequential blocks keep plain arrival order;
  - subagent **text** never folds into the main message (the no-partials
    `assistant_text` fallback previously could) and subagent **usage** no longer
    overwrites the main context-meter fallback. Subagent tool results still feed
    the Work log.
- **`completeTurn` keeps the interleave when the final text merely extends the
  streamed deltas.** `reconcileSegmentsWithText` now folds an unstreamed tail
  onto the trailing text run instead of collapsing the whole turn to
  blocks-first + one merged paragraph; only a genuinely divergent final text
  still falls back (`thread-store.ts`).
- Tests: +7 → **482** (subagent parsing/flagging ×3, store placement ×2,
  completion-tail reconcile, wire flag end-to-end through `AgentManager`).

### Fixed — `activeTurnId` clears before a turn's terminal status is observable
- **A just-ended turn could momentarily still report as active.** In
  `AgentManager`, `store.completeTurn`/`failTurn`/`abortTurn` flip the turn's
  status to a terminal value **inside** their mutation — observable via
  `getTurn` before the promise even resolves — while `#activeTurnByThread`, the
  map `turn/list` derives `activeTurnId` from, was cleared only afterwards. A
  `turn/list` (or a test) that observed the terminal status in that window still
  saw the turn as **completed yet active**, so the phone briefly kept the
  "responding…" indicator on an idle thread. The in-flight marker is now deleted
  **before** each terminal store call in all three handlers, so no observer ever
  sees a turn that is terminal yet still active; the status and `activeTurnId`
  flip together (`agent-manager.ts`). This makes the `activeTurnId …` /
  `turn/list … clears it on completion` tests deterministic (they were
  timing-dependent and flaked on the loaded node-24/ubuntu CI leg).

### Docs
- Sync the JSON-RPC method-count badges, the AGENTS.md agent roster (add Grok), the npm publish status and the PR-template test count with the code.

### Security
- Use constant-time comparisons for LAN approval-hook tokens.

## [0.0.7-alpha.20260716] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed — an omitted `params` no longer fails methods whose fields are all optional
- **`metrics/export` with no passphrase now works.** JSON-RPC 2.0 makes the
  `params` member optional and the phone omits it whenever every field is unset,
  but the optional param readers ran it through `asObject()`, which rejects an
  absent value — so the **default, no-passphrase** export was answered with
  `-32602 params must be an object`. The phone surfaces that as "couldn't create
  the backup, make sure you're connected to a PC", which pointed at the
  connection rather than the real cause. Exporting *with* a passphrase was
  unaffected (it sends an object).
- Root-caused in `handlers/params.ts`: `optionalString` / `optionalBoolean` /
  `optionalNumber` now read through an `optionalParams()` helper that treats an
  absent `params` as "no field set". Readers for a **required** field keep using
  `asObject()`, so a method that needs params still rejects an omitted one, and a
  `params` that is present but malformed is still `-32602`.
- Same bug, same fix: **`thread/list`** with no `projectId` (the threads screen's
  "list every thread" call) was rejected too, and `loadThreads` swallows the
  error — the bridge-side list sync silently no-op'd. `workspace/browseDirs`
  carried a local `p ?? {}` workaround for this; it's now redundant and removed
  in favour of the root fix.
- Covered by `test/handlers/params.test.ts` (8 tests, dispatched through the real
  router with `params` omitted exactly as the phone sends it).

## [0.0.6-alpha.20260716] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed — activity day buckets are timezone-stable
- The `metrics/get` `activity[].day` bucket key is now **UTC midnight of the
  bridge host's local calendar date** (`utcDayKey`, was the local-midnight
  *instant*). A local-midnight instant (e.g. `06:00Z` for a UTC-6 host)
  reconstructed on a phone in another timezone landed on the wrong calendar day,
  so the profile heatmap painted nothing while the stat tiles still showed the
  counts. UTC-midnight encoding matches the phone's per-cell key in any timezone.

### Added — bridge-owned profile metrics + tamper-proof backup (`metrics/*`)
- The bridge now **serves `metrics/get`, `metrics/export`, `metrics/import`** (66
  JSON-RPC methods now). It becomes the source of truth for the mobile profile
  metrics, which were phone-local and lost on an app uninstall.
- **Observation (the phone can't inflate the numbers):**
  - `metrics/metrics-store.ts` persists an event log at `~/.uxnan/metrics.json`
    (sessions + git actions, each with a stable id so imports merge idempotently).
  - **Connection sessions** are logged by `handleSecureConnection` (transport
    threaded through as `relay`/`direct`); a session left open by a crash is
    closed at startup at its own start time (counts the session, never inflates
    connected time).
  - **Git actions** are counted in `git-handler` for the mutating operations
    (commit/push/pull/checkout/createBranch/createWorktree/discard/createPr/
    undoCommit/switchBranch/revert/deleteBranch/removeWorktree), with outcome.
  - **Conversation counts** (conversations, messages, distinct agents/models,
    per-agent, member-since, per-day activity) are computed live from the
    `ThreadStore` (`conversationMetrics()`).
  - **Per-day per-agent activity** (`byAgentDay`): conversations, messages and
    **tokens processed** (each assistant turn's reported `usage.tokens`) summed
    per agent + UTC calendar day, for the unified agent-activity view. Agents
    that don't report usage still count their conversations/messages with tokens
    0; tokens are **processed, not billed cost** (`agent/usageStats` stays money).
- **Tamper-proof export/import** (`metrics/metrics-seal.ts`): the backup file is
  sealed with AES-256-GCM under a **32-byte key held in the OS keychain**
  (`metrics-seal-key`, via the existing `SecretStore`), with the header bound as
  AAD. Only the same bridge can verify + decrypt it, so users cannot fabricate or
  edit their stats; a foreign/edited file is rejected. **Same-PC only** by design.
  An optional user passphrase adds a scrypt-derived confidentiality layer.
- New `BridgeContext.metrics` (`MetricsService`); `metrics.json` added to
  `DAEMON_FILES`; `metrics-handler` registered. Spec: `architecture/02a` §5.8.11,
  `02b` §1.2 (method total 63 → 66).
- **Tests (+3 files):** `test/metrics/metrics-seal.test.ts` (round-trip,
  foreign-device, wrong-key, edited ciphertext/header, passphrase),
  `metrics-store.test.ts` (record/read, dangling-close, idempotent merge),
  `metrics-service.test.ts` (snapshot aggregation, live-session duration,
  export/import round-trip + rejection, passphrase). Transport/e2e tests that
  build a bridge switched to the resilient `rmrf` cleanup (the new async metric
  writes were racing plain `rm` on Windows).

### Fixed — CLI help/comment no longer calls `start` a skeleton
- The `start` usage line and the `cli.ts` header comment claimed a
  "skeleton: no live transport yet" — stale wording from an early increment.
  `start` boots the live LAN (and optional relay) transport with QR +
  manual-code pairing; the help and comment now say so.

### Added — `agent/usageStats` provider usage reader (bridge side)
- The bridge now **serves `agent/usageStats`** — previously a known method with no
  handler (`-32601`). A new TS reader (`src/usage/usage-reader.ts`) ports the
  desktop's native Rust reader: for each provider the user activated (**Codex,
  Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Grok**) it reads that CLI's own already-stored OAuth
  token (or `gh auth token` for Copilot) → the provider's official usage API and
  returns quota windows (% used + reset), plan/account and credit balance. Only the
  CLI's own token is read — never browser cookies or pasted keys. Each provider is
  isolated and best-effort: a slow/failed one degrades to its own `status`
  (`ok`/`authRequired`/`notInstalled`/`error`) + message and never rejects the whole
  call; 15 s per‑request timeout; 401/403 → `authRequired`. Handler
  `src/handlers/usage-handler.ts` validates the provider list. No new method (it was
  already in `METHOD_NAMES`); the phone-side UI is the remaining piece (mobile).

### Added — agent commands: discovery (`agent/commands`) + invocation (`turn/send` `command`)
- **What:** the bridge now discovers each agent's special ("slash") commands and
  runs them remotely. New handler `agent/commands` (`src/handlers/agent-handler.ts`)
  → `AgentManager.getCommands(agentId, cwd?)`; `turn/send` accepts a `command`
  (`{ name, args? }`) which `AgentManager.sendTurn` resolves to the prompt the
  agent runs. **63 JSON-RPC methods** now (`METHOD_NAMES`).
- **Two command classes, one invocation path** — every command runs through the
  existing streaming turn:
  - **Custom prompt-template commands** (`source: 'custom'`) — the bridge scans
    the agent's command directories and **expands the template itself** (argument
    substitution) via `expandCommand`, so they work even though the CLI's headless
    mode does not expand them. New shared helper `src/adapters/command-scan.ts`
    (dependency-free markdown-front-matter + TOML parsers; **Codex**
    `~/.codex/prompts/*.md`, **Gemini** `.gemini/commands/*.toml`, **OpenCode**
    `.opencode/command(s)/*.md`).
  - **Native control commands** — sent as the CLI's `/name args` form: **Claude
    Code** (advertised from the `system/init` `slash_commands` list captured per
    turn, ∪ a curated headless-safe built-in set ∪ `.claude/commands/*.md`; run
    against the thread's `--resume` session), and the **ACP agents Zero/Grok**
    (advertised from the ACP `available_commands_update` notification the adapters
    now capture instead of dropping; invoked via `session/prompt`).
- **Capability:** the five command-capable adapters set `capabilities.commands =
  true`. `pi` advertises none (no documented command surface).
- **History:** a command turn persists the `/name args` form (not the expansion)
  as the user message. Covered by new `command-scan` + `agent-manager` tests.

## [0.0.5-alpha.20260711] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed — turn errors are surfaced with the real reason and survive re-sync
- **Real error detail (ACP adapters):** when an ACP turn fails (Grok / Zero), the
  useful reason (e.g. a 402 `API error (status 402 Payment Required): … usage
  balance exhausted`) lives in the JSON-RPC error's **`data.message`**; the
  adapters were surfacing only the generic top-level `message` ("Internal error").
  `errorMessage()` in `grok-adapter.ts` and `zero-adapter.ts` now prefers
  `data.message` when present, so the `stream/turn/error` the phone renders tells
  the user *why* the turn failed.
- **Persisted for re-sync:** on `turn_error` the `AgentManager` now appends a
  `system`/`error` content block (`errorBlock` in `content-blocks.ts`) to the
  turn's history (via `store.appendBlock`), so a `turn/list` re-sync — e.g. after a
  bridge restart — still shows the failure reason. It is **not** broadcast as a
  `stream/content/block` (the phone renders the failure live from `turn/error`, so
  notifying too would double the banner). Covered by new `grok-adapter` +
  `agent-manager` tests.

### Added — Grok agent wired over the Agent Client Protocol (ACP)
- **What:** **Grok** (xAI's coding CLI, `grok`) is now a real wired agent (AgentId
  `grok`, display name `Grok`) — the **seventh** alongside OpenCode, Claude Code,
  Codex, pi, Gemini CLI and Zero. New adapter `src/adapters/grok-adapter.ts` (+
  `grok-tools.ts`, `resolve-grok.ts`), registered in `startBridge`.
- **Transport (ACP):** the bridge drives `grok agent stdio`, which speaks
  **JSON-RPC 2.0 over newline-delimited stdio** (the Agent Client Protocol, the
  same protocol as Zero) — the bridge is the ACP *client*, like an editor. The
  adapter reuses the Codex NDJSON transport; turns run as ACP `session/new` +
  `session/prompt`, with `session/load` restoring a persisted session for
  continuity. The native `grok` executable (`~/.grok/bin/grok`) spawns directly
  with `shell:false` (no shell shim), resolved by `resolve-grok.ts`.
- **Real interactive approvals:** ACP `session/request_permission` is routed
  through the bridge's shared `requestApproval` round-trip (the same one Claude /
  Codex / OpenCode / Gemini / Zero use); the phone's decision maps by the ACP
  option `kind` to `allow_once` / `allow_always` / `reject_once`. The thread's
  `accessMode` selects the posture (`requestApproval` asks the phone;
  `approveForMe` / `fullAccess` answer without it). `approvals` capability **`true`**.
- **Plan + streaming:** `planMode`, `streaming` and `forking` are `true` — plan
  updates and streamed content/thinking are re-emitted as the same structured
  `stream/*` shape as every other agent (`grok-tools.ts` maps ACP tool calls / plan
  steps to the shared content blocks, so the phone renders **the same widgets** —
  PlanCard, DiffBlock, CommandCard — regardless of Grok's own tool names). `images`
  is **`false`** (Grok's ACP `promptCapabilities.image` is false).
- **Model discovery (real, from the handshake):** Grok reports its models —
  **with context window (`totalContextTokens`) and per-model reasoning-effort
  knobs (`reasoningEfforts`)** — directly in the `initialize` handshake's
  `_meta.modelState`, so `agent/models` needs no extra CLI call or session. The
  chosen model is applied via the standard ACP `session/set_model`; the chosen
  reasoning effort via `session/set_mode` (Grok exposes effort as its ACP "modes").
- **Sign-in status:** `auth/status` reports Grok via the presence of
  `~/.grok/auth.json` (provider `xai`), never reading the token.
- **Verification caveat:** the ACP envelope, handshake and model discovery were
  exercised against a live `grok 0.2.93`. The per-turn streaming shapes
  (`tool_call` / `plan` / `session/request_permission`), whether Grok reports token
  usage, and whether `session/set_mode` actually applies the effort could **not** be
  exercised end-to-end because the test account's Grok Build balance was exhausted
  (HTTP 402) — tracked in `FOR-DEV.md`. `reportsContextUsage` is `false` pending
  that check.
- **Validated:** **18 unit tests** in `test/adapters/grok-adapter.test.ts` (model
  mapping, streaming, effort, interactive/auto approvals, plan blocks, session reuse,
  cancel) + cross-agent consistency assertions in `plan-blocks.test.ts` (Grok/Zero
  plan + execute blocks normalize identically to the CLI agents) + `account-status`
  coverage. The bridge suite is green at **424 tests**.

### Added — Zero agent wired over the Agent Client Protocol (ACP)
- **What:** **Zero** (https://github.com/Gitlawb/zero), an open-source Go coding
  agent, is now a real wired agent (AgentId `zero`, display name `Zero`) — the
  sixth alongside OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, pi and Gemini CLI. New adapter
  `src/adapters/zero-adapter.ts` (+ `zero-tools.ts`, `resolve-zero.ts`), registered
  in `startBridge`. There is **no remaining planned agent** (the previously-listed
  Aider is no longer planned).
- **Transport (ACP):** the bridge drives `zero acp`, which speaks **JSON-RPC 2.0
  over newline-delimited stdio** (the Agent Client Protocol) — the bridge is the
  ACP *client*, like an editor. The adapter reuses the Codex NDJSON transport; turns
  run as ACP `session/new` + `session/prompt`, with `session/load` restoring a
  persisted session for continuity.
- **Real interactive approvals:** ACP `session/request_permission` is routed through
  the bridge's shared `requestApproval` round-trip (the same one Claude / Codex /
  OpenCode / Gemini use); the phone's decision maps by the ACP option `kind` to
  `allow_once` / `allow_always` / `reject_once`. The thread's `accessMode` selects
  the ACP **session mode**: `requestApproval` → `ask` (interactive), while
  `approveForMe` / `fullAccess` → `auto` (answered without the phone). The
  `approvals` capability is **`true`**.
- **Plan + streaming:** `planMode`, `streaming`, `forking` and `images` are `true` —
  plan updates and streamed content/thinking are re-emitted as the same structured
  `stream/*` shape as the other agents (`zero-tools.ts` maps ACP tool calls / plan
  steps to content blocks).
- **Model discovery (real, per-install):** the model list is Zero's **own configured
  providers**, not a built-in registry — `zero providers list --json` enumerates the
  configured providers and, per available provider, `zero providers models <name>
  --json` lists its models; the results are unioned and de-duplicated into
  `AgentModel[]` (with `contextWindow`). If the structured probe yields nothing it
  falls back to parsing `zero models list` text. The list is cached per adapter.
- **Interactive questions (`ask_user`):** Zero's `ask_user` tool is **non-interactive
  over ACP** — Zero's ACP agent wires no answer handler, so the call auto-completes
  with "proceed with your best assumption" and the turn continues. The bridge can't
  answer it, but renders the questions/options it asked **legibly** (instead of a raw
  args dump) so the user still sees what was asked. Making it answerable needs an
  upstream Zero change (tracked in `FOR-DEV.md`).
- **No context usage over ACP:** ACP carries no per-turn token usage, so Zero reports
  `reportsContextUsage:false` and the phone shows no context meter for it (tracked in
  `FOR-DEV.md`, together with the still-missing on-disk `turn/list` history reader for
  Zero's ACP sessions).
- **Validated:** end-to-end against the real `zero.exe` (streaming + a real
  shell-command approval + completion + real per-install model discovery) plus **9
  unit tests** in `test/adapters/zero-adapter.test.ts`. The bridge suite is green at
  **408 tests**.

### Changed — OpenCode now runs via `opencode serve` (real interactive approvals)
- **Why:** the old adapter drove `opencode run --format json`, a one-shot,
  non-interactive process that ran tools autonomously and emitted tool events only
  *after* the tool ran — so the bridge could never gate a sensitive action
  (`approvals` was `false`), plan/to-do arrived as a doubly-emitted `todowrite` we
  de-duped by hand, and every turn respawned the CLI.
- **What:** the adapter now speaks HTTP + Server-Sent-Events to a long-lived,
  loopback-bound `opencode serve` process (one per working directory, spawned
  lazily), mirroring the Codex `app-server` adapter. New `opencode-server.ts` is a
  dependency-free HTTP/SSE client (`IOpenCodeServer`); the adapter maps the `/event`
  bus onto bridge events:
  - **Streaming** — `message.part.delta`/`message.part.updated`, routed to assistant
    text vs `thinking` by the part's *type* (both stream as `field:"text"`), and
    filtered to the assistant message (the user's echoed text part no longer leaks).
  - **Real approvals** — `permission.asked` is routed through the bridge's shared
    `requestApproval` round-trip (the same one Claude/Codex/Gemini use); the reply
    maps `approve|approveSession|reject` → `once|always|reject`. `accessMode`
    becomes a per-session permission ruleset: `ask` on `edit`/`bash`/`webfetch`/
    `external_directory` (interactive by default), `allow` for approveForMe·fullAccess.
    `approvals` capability is now **`true`**.
  - **Plan mode** — native `todo.updated` replaces the `todowrite` double-emit hack
    (still merged into one plan card at turn close).
  - **Completion / usage** — `session.idle` completes the turn; per-turn tokens come
    from `step-finish.tokens` / the assistant message; `session.error` → `turn_error`.
  - **Continuity** — one server session per thread, persisted (survives a server
    restart; still feeds the on-disk `turn/list` history fallback). Cancellation via
    `POST /session/{id}/abort`.
  - **Race-free startup** — the server's `start()` now AWAITS the `/event` SSE
    subscription being established before the first session/prompt. The bus only
    delivers events emitted after a subscriber connects, so a fire-and-forget
    subscription dropped the entire first turn on slower/remote setups ("first turn
    shows nothing", and the stuck turn then confused follow-ups); found in on-device
    testing. A superseded, never-idled run is also retired when a new turn starts.
  - **All elicitation channels handled (no hangs)** — besides `permission.asked`
    (v1), the adapter routes `permission.v2.asked` (`action`/`resources` shape)
    through the same approval round-trip, and surfaces `question.asked` /
    `question.v2.asked` (the agent's multiple-choice `question` tool) as a new
    **interactive question** flow: the bridge emits a `question` content block
    (`{ questionId, questions:[{question,header?,options:[{label,description?}],multiple?}] }`),
    the phone answers via `turn/send { questionResponse: { questionId, answers } }`,
    and the adapter replies to `/question/{id}/reply` so the agent continues with
    the user's choice (an empty/timed-out answer rejects the question to unblock).
    New shared contract `QuestionRequestBlock`/`QuestionResponse`;
    `AgentManager.requestQuestion`/`respondQuestion` mirror the approval round-trip.
    Validated end-to-end against a live `opencode serve` (agent asks → phone answers
    → agent uses the answer → turn completes).
  - **Debug tracing** — set `UXNAN_OPENCODE_DEBUG=1` to log the turn/event/approval
    flow to stderr (session/prompt, each meaningful `/event`, the `permission.asked`
    → decision → reply round-trip, completion) for diagnosing a stuck turn.
- Model discovery + context windows keep the short-lived `opencode models`
  (`--verbose`) spawns (unchanged). Validated end-to-end against a live
  `opencode serve` (streaming + a real `edit` approval → file written). New unit
  tests: `opencode-adapter.test.ts` (16) + `opencode-server.test.ts` (6).

### Fixed — OpenCode plan/todo now emits a single, status-advancing plan card
- **Root cause:** OpenCode's `todowrite` tool fires **up to twice per turn** with
  the same (or progressively-updated) todo list, and `planMode` was advertised as
  `false`, so the mobile both rendered two near-duplicate plan cards and hid the
  plan-mode capability chip.
- **Fix (`opencode-adapter.ts` + `opencode-tools.ts`):** the adapter now collects
  `todowrite` steps into a turn-scoped `planSteps` buffer and merges every emit via
  the new `mergePlanSteps` (dedup by `description`, advance status strictly
  forward `pending → in_progress → completed`, order-stable), then emits **one**
  `plan` block at turn close (`finish`). `planMode` is now advertised `true` so the
  mobile shows the plan-mode chip and banner. Added unit tests in
  `test/adapters/plan-blocks.test.ts`.

### Fixed — stop-turn now cancels turns on non-default agents
- **Root cause:** `AgentManager.cancelTurn` resolved the adapter from the configured
  `defaultAgent`, but `turn/cancel` never passes an `agentId`. A thread running on
  any **non-default** agent (Zero, OpenCode, …) had its cancel routed to the wrong
  adapter, which no-oped — so the phone's Stop button did nothing and the turn kept
  running. It only appeared to work when the thread happened to be on the default
  agent.
- **Fix (`agent-manager.ts`):** `cancelTurn` now resolves the thread's **own** agent
  from `#agentByThread` (the same lookup `respondApproval` / `respondQuestion` use),
  falling back to the default only when the thread has no recorded agent. Added a
  regression test in `test/agents/agent-manager.test.ts`.

## [0.0.4-alpha.20260703] - 2026-07-03

### Changed — npm releases now publish to the `latest` dist-tag
- `release-npm.yml` published every version under the **`alpha`** dist-tag, so
  `npm install -g uxnan-bridge` kept resolving the **first** version ever
  published (`latest` was stuck at `0.0.1-alpha.20260627`, never advanced). The
  workflow now publishes to **`latest`**, so the newest release is what
  `npm install` and the self-update check resolve. Pre-release channels
  (`alpha`/`beta`) are opt-in — add them manually per build
  (`npm dist-tag add uxnan-bridge@<version> beta`). Convention documented in
  `VERSIONS.md`; a one-time manual `npm dist-tag add` is needed to move the
  already-published packages' `latest` forward (see `VERSIONS.md`).

### Added — self-update check (CLI notice + `bridge/status` fields for the phone)
- **Background npm update check** (`src/update-check.ts`): the bridge is the
  ecosystem's core engine, so it now checks whether a newer build has been
  published to npm under the `latest` dist-tag and nudges the user to update. It
  queries `registry.npmjs.org/-/package/uxnan-bridge/dist-tags`, caches the
  result in `~/.uxnan/update-check.json` (24h TTL, new `DAEMON_FILES.updateCheck`),
  and compares versions with the new shared `isNewerVersion` (SemVer precedence).
  The check is best-effort and non-blocking — any offline/parse failure is
  swallowed (reported as "unknown"), and the daemon refreshes it in the
  background on boot and every 6h (unref'd timer, cleared on stop).
- **CLI notice:** `start`, `status`, `qr` and `code` print a one-line
  "A newer bridge is available: <version> … npm install -g uxnan-bridge@latest"
  to **stderr** (so it never corrupts the stdout of `status`/`code`) when the
  running version is outdated; silent otherwise.
- **`bridge/status` now carries `latestVersion` + `updateAvailable`** (shared
  `BridgeStatus`), populated from the cached check via the new
  `BridgeContext.updateStatus()`. Lets the phone show a "bridge update available"
  hint **without querying npm itself** (see `uxnanmobile`). `buildBridgeStatus`
  includes the fields only when known.
- **`version.ts`** now also exports `BRIDGE_PACKAGE_NAME` (read from
  `package.json`), so the update check can never drift from what's published.
- Tests: 11 new (`test/update-check.test.ts`) covering the registry parse, TTL
  caching, offline fallback, and the CLI notice message. Reflected in
  `shared/` (`compareVersions`/`isNewerVersion`, `BridgeStatus` fields),
  `architecture/02a` (§5.8 bridge status) and `02b` (`bridge/status` result).

## [0.0.3-alpha.20260702] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed — seeded model list no longer frozen to disk (new models reach existing installs)
- **Root cause:** `initConfig` wrote the *entire* `DEFAULT_DAEMON_CONFIG` —
  including the seeded `agents.claude-code.models` — to `~/.uxnan/daemon-config.json`
  on first run, and `resolveDaemonConfig` let that persisted list **replace** the
  code default. So a new app version that added a model to the seed (e.g. Sonnet 5)
  never reached an existing install; the user had to hand-edit the file.
- **Fix (`src/daemon-config.ts`, `src/daemon-state.ts`):**
  - `resolveDaemonConfig` now **unions** the built-in seeded `models` with the
    user's, deduped by id (new `mergeAgentModels`): the seed is a live baseline
    from code, the user's entries are additions/overrides (a same-id entry wins
    its `displayName`; a new id is appended). A persisted (stale) list can no
    longer shadow newly-seeded models.
  - `initConfig` persists the seed **without** the `agents` block, so the built-in
    model lists are never frozen to disk.
  - Behavior change: an empty `"models": []` no longer clears the baseline (the
    union always keeps it). Docs updated (`docs/agents.md`, `docs/configuration.md`).
  - 4 tests added/updated (`daemon-config.test.ts`, `daemon-state.test.ts`),
    incl. a persisted-list-still-gains-new-models case and a no-freeze-to-disk case.

### Added — Claude Code aliases flagged `isLatestAlias` on `agent/models`
- **`ClaudeCodeAdapter.listModels()`** (`src/adapters/claude-adapter.ts`) now
  sets `isLatestAlias: true` on each stable alias entry (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`)
  it advertises. The concrete pinned versions leave it absent. This is the
  `@uxnan/shared` `AgentModel.isLatestAlias` contract field — it lets the phone
  offer to hide the moving-target aliases and show only exact versions without
  hardcoding ids. 2 assertions added to `claude-adapter.test.ts`.

### Added — Claude Code `Sonnet 5` in the seeded model picker
- **`claude-sonnet-5` ("Sonnet 5")** seeded in Claude Code's default
  `models` list (`src/daemon-config.ts`), so a fresh install offers the newest
  Sonnet-tier version as an explicit pick alongside the auto-updating
  `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` aliases. The `sonnet` alias already tracks "latest",
  so this is a convenience/visibility entry; `claudeContextWindow` already maps
  any `sonnet` id to the 1M window, so no adapter change was needed. Docs
  (`docs/agents.md`, `docs/configuration.md`) and the `daemon-config` seed test
  updated to match.

## [0.0.2-alpha.20260628] - 2026-06-28

### Added — `workspace/searchFiles` handler (repo-wide fuzzy file search)
- **`WorkspaceService.searchFiles(root, query, limit?)`**
  (`src/workspace/workspace-service.ts`) + the `workspace/searchFiles` handler
  registration — a fuzzy file search across the whole repo for the mobile `@`
  picker. In a git repo it gathers candidates via a single `git ls-files
  --cached --others --exclude-standard` (tracked + untracked, honoring
  `.gitignore`) plus their ancestor directories; outside a repo it falls back to
  a bounded recursive walk. Excludes `.git` + sensitive files (same posture as
  `workspace/list`); ranks basename-substring > path-substring > subsequence;
  clamps `limit` (default 40, max 100) and flags `truncated`. 5 new
  `workspace-service` tests. Contract lives in `@uxnan/shared`.

## [0.0.1-alpha.20260627] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed — recovered conversations keep the real text↔work-log order
- **The thread store now records an ordered `Message.segments` interleave**
  (`src/conversation/thread-store.ts`). Each assistant message kept `text`
  (concatenated deltas) and `blocks` (the structured work-log/diff/tool blocks)
  in **separate** fields, which lost the order they streamed in — so on a
  `turn/list` re-sync (a phone reconnecting to a still-running bridge) the
  recovered turn rendered every command/log stacked **above** one merged
  paragraph instead of inline with the response. `appendDelta` / `appendBlock`
  now also append to a `segments` array (text runs grown in place, blocks pushed
  as they land), `completeTurn` reconciles it against the authoritative final
  text, and `toMessage` emits `segments` whenever the turn carries a structured
  block. `content` + `blocks` are unchanged (back-compat + reconciliation), and a
  plain-text turn ships no `segments` (its lean wire shape is untouched). The
  on-disk history fallback (`session-history.ts`, after a bridge restart) still
  emits blocks-first — tracked in `FOR-DEV.md`. Tests: +3
  (`thread-store.test.ts`: interleave preserved across a delta→block→delta turn;
  a plain-text turn ships no segments; a no-delta turn appends the final text
  after its blocks) → **360 bridge**. Spec: `architecture/02b` (`Message`).

### Fixed — `git/log` commit order matches the desktop ADE and GitHub
- **`git/log` now uses `--date-order` instead of `--topo-order`**
  (`src/git/git-service.ts`). `--topo-order` groups each branch's commits
  together regardless of commit date, so on the phone some commits appeared far
  above/below others made around the same time. `--date-order` orders by commit
  time while still never showing a parent before its children — matching the
  desktop ADE (git2 `Sort::TOPOLOGICAL | TIME`) and GitHub's commit list. It is
  still a valid topological order, so the swimlane graph stays clean. Spec:
  `architecture/02a` `handleGitLog`.

### Added — `workspace/list` flags git-ignored entries
- **`workspace/list` now reports `ignored: true` on entries git ignores**
  (`src/workspace/workspace-service.ts`). A single `git check-ignore -z --stdin`
  per listing classifies the directory's names; a non-repo (or any git error)
  just leaves every entry un-flagged, so the file browser keeps working outside a
  repository. Tracked files matching an ignore rule are *not* flagged (git knows
  they're tracked). Lets the mobile file browser dim ignored entries (muted +
  italic). It is **not** a `git/status` field — ignored entries never appear in
  the changed-file list, so the flag rides on the listing and the Git screen's
  change counts are untouched.
- **`runGit` accepts an `input` option** (`src/git/git-runner.ts`) to feed a
  command's stdin (used for `check-ignore --stdin`); the write is guarded against
  a closed pipe. Tests: +2 (`workspace-service.test.ts`: a listing flags an
  ignored file + directory and leaves tracked/clean ones alone; a non-repo
  listing flags nothing) → **357 bridge**.

### Added — `workspace/list` entries carry a last-modified time
- **`workspace/list` now returns `mtime` (epoch ms) on file entries**
  (`src/workspace/workspace-service.ts`). It reuses the same `stat` call that
  already produced `size`, so there's no extra I/O; directories carry neither
  `size` nor `mtime`. Lets the mobile file browser show a per-file "modified"
  line. Test: `workspace-service.test.ts` now asserts file entries carry
  `size` + `mtime` and directory entries carry neither.

### Fixed — stop advertising unreachable virtual-NIC addresses (Bug A relink latency)
- **`src/transport/local-hosts.ts` now excludes host-only virtual adapters** from
  the directly-reachable hosts advertised in the pairing QR / mDNS. Hyper-V and WSL
  virtual switches (`vEthernet (…)`), the Hyper-V "Default Switch", Docker bridges
  (`docker0`, `br-…`), VirtualBox and VMware host-only nets all report a
  non-internal IPv4 (e.g. `172.27.192.1`) that is **not reachable from a phone**, so
  the phone wasted a full connect timeout (~2 s) on each dead address on every
  (re)connect — a confirmed contributor to the post-resume relink latency captured
  in the `[reconn]` logs. The new `isVirtualInterfaceName` name filter is
  deliberately conservative: it never matches a real LAN NIC (`Ethernet`, `Wi-Fi`)
  or Tailscale (`Tailscale` / `tailscale0` / `utunN`), so direct LAN + Tailscale
  keep working. Tests: +2 (`test/transport/local-hosts.test.ts`) → **355 bridge**.

### Added — surface the in-flight turn on `turn/list` (phone re-attach)
- **`turn/list` now returns `activeTurnId`** when a turn is in flight for the
  thread. New `AgentManager.activeTurnId(threadId)` exposes the live
  `#activeTurnByThread` state (set on `sendTurn`, cleared on
  completion/error/abort), and the `turn/list` handler attaches it to the
  result (`src/agents/agent-manager.ts`, `src/handlers/thread-context-handler.ts`).
  This is authoritative "is a turn running NOW?" state — unlike a stored turn's
  `streaming` status it is absent after a bridge restart (the agent child died),
  so the phone never re-attaches to a turn that already ended. Lets a phone that
  reconnected mid-turn restore its "responding…" indicator + Stop button instead
  of treating the turn as dead (the mobile companion fix; see
  `uxnanmobile/CHANGELOG.md`). Spec: `architecture/02b` (`TurnList` + `turn/list`).
  Tests: `test/agents/agent-manager.test.ts` (getter set/clear) +
  `test/handlers/thread-handlers.test.ts` (turn/list in-flight → activeTurnId).
  Suite: 353 bridge.

### Added — per-turn access-mode enforcement for Gemini & Codex
- **Gemini and Codex now honor the thread's `accessMode`** (the per-thread
  approval mode chosen on the phone), not just Claude. Each maps
  `SendTurnOptions.accessMode` to its own per-turn permission posture, with the
  configured `permissionMode` as the fallback when no mode is set:
  - **Gemini** (`src/adapters/gemini-adapter.ts`, new `#effectiveMode`):
    `approveForMe` → `--approval-mode auto_edit`, `fullAccess` →
    `--approval-mode yolo`, `requestApproval` → interactive `BeforeTool` hook
    (`--approval-mode default`) when the bridge endpoint is resolvable, else a
    fallback to the configured posture (so a bridge without a wired hook never
    fails the turn). Gemini spawns one CLI per turn, so the mode applies
    per-turn with no continuity caveat.
  - **Codex** (`src/adapters/codex-adapter.ts`, new `#effectiveMode`):
    `requestApproval` → `(on-request, workspace-write)`, `approveForMe` →
    `(never, workspace-write)`, `fullAccess` → `(never, danger-full-access)`.
    Applied at `thread/start`, so it governs a thread from its first turn; a
    mid-thread access-mode change does not re-issue `thread/start` and only
    affects threads started afterward (FOR-DEV: per-turn re-apply on an existing
    app-server thread).
  - Closes the bridge side of "Access-mode enforcement for non-Claude agents"
    (see `uxnanmobile/FOR-DEV.md`). pi/OpenCode still can't gate tools (headless
    modes have no pre-tool channel), so they don't map `accessMode`.
  - Spec: `architecture/02b-contracts-and-requirements.md`
    (`thread/setAccessMode` → *Enforcement*). Tests: `test/adapters/gemini-adapter.test.ts`
    (4 cases) + `test/adapters/codex-adapter.test.ts` (2 cases). Adds 6 bridge tests.

### Fixed — git/log dropped commits & produced a tangled graph
- **`git/log` no longer loses commits or invents lanes on a branchy history.**
  Three coupled fixes in `src/git/git-service.ts`:
  - **Topological order** (`--topo-order`) instead of git's default date order,
    so a commit's parents immediately follow it — the phone's swimlane graph
    stays clean (no lanes dangling across unrelated commits → no phantom lanes)
    and matches `git log --graph` / VS Code.
  - **Offset pagination** (`--skip <n>`, `cursor` = an opaque offset token)
    replacing the previous `<cursor>^` (first-parent) scheme, which skipped a
    merge's second-parent history across page boundaries and silently dropped
    real commits.
  - **Merge-safe shortstat parsing.** Merge (and empty) commits emit no
    `--shortstat`, so the record after a merge began with a bare `-z` NUL
    terminator; the parser assumed a `\n<stat>\n` prefix, mis-split the fields
    and dropped that commit. It now strips the leading NUL before splitting.
  - Tests: a merge-DAG pagination test asserting no commit is dropped.

### Added — richer git history (refs + commit detail)
- **`git/log` now decorates commits with refs.** `GitService.log` runs with
  `--decorate=full` and a `%D` field, parsed into `GitCommit.refs[]`
  (HEAD / local branch / remote branch / tag) — powering branch/tag chips and
  HEAD highlighting in the mobile history graph. `src/git/git-service.ts`
  (`parseRefs`, log format/args).
- **New `git/commitShow { cwd, sha }` method.** Returns a commit's full detail:
  metadata (incl. `refs`), the files it touched joined from `--name-status`
  (status + rename `oldPath`) and `--numstat` (per-file +/-, `binary`), and the
  complete unified diff (capped at ~400 KB → `diffTruncated`). Wired through
  `git-handler.ts` (`requireString` cwd + `requireSafe` sha) and the
  `GitService.commitShow` / `#commitFiles` helpers (`mapNameStatus`,
  `renameNewPath`, `parseCommitMeta`). Tests in `test/git/git-service.test.ts`.

### Fixed — tool approvals no longer auto-reject while the phone is backgrounded
- **Connection-aware approval timeout.** `AgentManager.requestApproval`'s
  auto-reject countdown (`APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS`, 5 min) now only runs while a
  phone has a live channel. While no phone is connected the approval **waits**
  (its card is already replayed from the per-device outbound log on reconnect),
  so a turn that hits an approval (incl. Claude's `AskUserQuestion`) while the
  app is backgrounded no longer defaults to `reject` on a prompt the user never
  saw — which made the agent take an unauthorized default and the turn appear
  "cut". A phone (re)connect grants a fresh window; the last disconnect pauses
  the countdown. Wired via `SessionRegistry.anyActive()` →
  `AgentManager.isPhoneConnected`, with `onPhoneConnected` / `onPhoneDisconnected`
  called from the session handler on sink register/unregister. New
  `approvalTimeoutMs` option (test seam). Files: `src/agents/agent-manager.ts`,
  `src/transport/session-registry.ts`, `src/transport/session-handler.ts`,
  `src/bridge.ts`. Tests: `test/agents/agent-manager.test.ts` (offline-wait +
  disconnect-pause).
- **Approval hooks wait long enough for the user to return.** The Claude
  `PreToolUse` hook (and the Gemini `BeforeTool` hook) now set an explicit
  `timeout` of 1800 s, well above the CLI's ~60 s default. Without it the CLI
  aborted the hook (defaulting the tool to deny) long before a backgrounded
  phone could reconnect and answer — the other half of the same "auto-answered"
  bug. Files: `src/adapters/claude-adapter.ts`, `src/adapters/gemini-adapter.ts`.

### Changed — push notifications doc moved here, rewritten bridge-first
- `relay/docs/push-notifications.md` → **`bridge/docs/push-notifications.md`**.
  Reframed bridge-first: background push is delivered **directly by the bridge**
  via FCM by default (the bridge owns the Firebase service account at
  `~/.uxnan/firebase-service-account.json` and sends on any transport); a
  self-hosted relay holding the credential is now documented only as the
  optional delivery fallback. The "Docs" links in both `bridge/README.md` and
  `relay/README.md` were updated to point here.

### Changed — macOS LaunchAgent label renamed `com.uxnan.bridge` → `dev.luisgamas.bridge`
- **`LAUNCH_LABEL` constant updated** in `src/service-installer.ts`. The
  label is the reverse-DNS identifier used by `launchctl` (and is also the
  basename of the per-user LaunchAgent plist):
  - Plist path: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.luisgamas.bridge.plist`
    (was `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.uxnan.bridge.plist`)
  - Plist `Label` key: `dev.luisgamas.bridge` (was `com.uxnan.bridge`)
- **Legacy install script mirrored.** `scripts/install-service-macos.sh`
  rewrites the plist path, label and trailing echo to use the new id (the
  script is the reference recipe; the live code path is the in-process
  installer in `service-installer.ts`).
- **Test aligned.** `test/service-installer.test.ts` "macOS plan writes a
  LaunchAgent plist and loads it" now asserts the plist path under
  `dev.luisgamas.bridge.plist`. The Linux and Windows plans are unaffected
  (Linux uses a `uxnan-bridge.service` systemd unit, Windows uses a Task
  Scheduler entry named `UxnanBridge` — neither was namespace-derived).
- **No uninstall migration.** The old plist (if previously installed as
  `com.uxnan.bridge.plist`) is **not** auto-removed — the user must run the
  uninstall path once (`uxnan-bridge service uninstall`) to drop the old
  file before installing under the new label. Re-install under the new
  label works without uninstalling first; macOS just keeps both plists.
- **Spec updated.** `architecture/02a-system-architecture.md` §5.8.4
  LaunchAgent path, and `uxnandesktop/architecture/02e-bridge-integration.md`
  autostart table, both reflect the new id.

### Fixed
- **A stale connection no longer clobbers a reconnecting phone's live session
  (LAN/direct).** On the direct path a returning phone opens a *new* connection
  whose handshake re-registers its push sink, active session and session-state
  entry — while the old connection's socket may still be half-open. When that
  stale connection finally tore down, its `finally` unconditionally removed the
  sink (`SessionRegistry.unregister`), the `SessionState` entry and the
  `pushService` active session — silently killing the **newer** connection's
  push/streaming delivery after a background reconnect. `unregister` now takes
  the sink and only removes it when it is still the current one (returns
  `false` when superseded), and `handleSecureConnection`'s teardown is gated on
  that result so a superseded connection leaves the live session untouched.
  Covered by `test/transport/notify.test.ts`
  ("a stale unregister does not drop a sink a reconnect already replaced").

### Added
- **Agent plan / to-do lists mapped to `plan` content blocks.** A new
  `planBlock` builder + tolerant `extractPlanSteps` (content-blocks.ts) turn an
  agent's plan-tool input into the `{ type:'plan', state:{ title?, steps:[{
  description, status }] } }` block the phone renders as a checklist. Wired per
  agent: **Claude** `TodoWrite` (confident), **OpenCode** `todowrite`, **pi**
  `todo`, **Codex** `update_plan` item. Emits a block only when ≥1 step parses
  (a wrong/absent shape → no block, never a malformed one). Codex/OpenCode/pi
  tool names + shapes are ASSUMED and flagged `FOR-DEV:` for live confirmation;
  Claude is verified by shape. Covered by `test/adapters/plan-blocks.test.ts`.
- **Per-thread access mode is now enforced per turn (Claude).** `turn/send`
  reads the thread's persisted `accessMode` (`ThreadRuntime.accessMode` →
  `SendTurnOptions.accessMode`) and the Claude adapter maps it to the right CLI
  posture: `requestApproval` keeps the interactive `PreToolUse` hook,
  `approveForMe` → `--permission-mode acceptEdits` (hook suppressed),
  `fullAccess` → `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Non-breaking: a thread with
  no mode keeps the adapter's configured posture (the validated interactive
  approvals are untouched), and `requestApproval` without a usable hook falls
  back to that posture instead of denying. Other agents accept the field and
  ignore it for now. Covered by four adapter tests + a runtime test.
- **Agent session id surfaced + per-thread access mode persisted.**
  `toThread` now includes `agentSessionId` (the agent's native session id) so
  `thread/read`/`thread/list` carry it for the phone's "resume from the CLI".
  New `thread/setAccessMode { threadId, mode }` handler + `ThreadStore.setAccessMode`
  (idempotent) persist the per-thread approval mode (`AccessMode`); `toThread`
  returns `accessMode`. Covered by `test/conversation/thread-store.test.ts`.
- **`turn/list` newest-first pagination.** The handler now accepts
  `fromEnd?: boolean` and the response carries `total` (full turn count).
  `ThreadStore.listTurns` (and the on-disk-history `paginateTurns` fallback)
  honour `fromEnd` by returning the last `limit` turns and always report
  `total`, so the phone can open a long thread at its newest messages and page
  backward by computing offsets instead of pulling the whole thread. Cursor
  semantics (forward offset, oldest→newest) are unchanged and backward
  compatible. Covered by `test/conversation/thread-store.test.ts`.
- **Seq-based catch-up on reconnect (bridge half)** — the bridge now retains
  every bridge→phone message (replies AND notifications) in a per-device
  **`OutboundLog`** (architecture/02a §5.9.2): a continuous, monotonic `seq`
  counter that **survives reconnects** plus a sliding window of the recent
  **plaintext** (caps `MAX_BRIDGE_OUTBOUND_MESSAGES` / `_BYTES`). On the
  handshake, `performServerHandshake` reads
  `clientHello.resumeState.lastAppliedBridgeOutboundSeq` (tolerant: absent /
  invalid → 0) and the session handler **replays every retained entry with a
  greater seq**, re-encrypted under the new session key (`BridgeSecureChannel.
  encryptReplay`), BEFORE registering the live sink so the backlog precedes new
  traffic. Plaintext (not envelopes) is retained because each reconnect derives
  a fresh key. The channel's `seq` is now owned by the log, so it continues
  across reconnects instead of restarting at 1; messages sent while a device is
  offline are recorded in its log (not a separate buffer) and replayed too. The
  log is created on first use, kept across disconnects, and dropped only when
  the device is untrusted (`SessionRegistry.forget`, wired into
  `bridge/removeTrustedDevice`). Replaces the old `OutboundMessageBuffer`
  (offline-only, no seq, drain-on-register) with `OutboundLog`. Covered by
  `outbound-log.test.ts`, `secure-channel.test.ts` (log continuity +
  `encryptReplay`), and an end-to-end reconnect catch-up test
  (`catch-up.test.ts`): a phone that applied seq 1–2, went offline while the
  bridge produced seq 3–4, reconnects with `resumeState:{...Seq:2}` and receives
  exactly seq 3–4 under the new key. **Mobile half still pending:** the phone
  must persist `lastAppliedBridgeOutboundSeq` and send it in `clientHello.
  resumeState` (until then the bridge replays nothing, since the phone reports
  no resume point) — tracked in FOR-DEV.
- **Codex real approvals via the `codex app-server` turn protocol** — the
  bridge's Codex adapter is refactored from one-shot `codex exec --json` to
  a **long-lived** `codex app-server` JSON-RPC process. The new path speaks
  the full turn protocol (`initialize` → `thread/start` → `turn/start`) and
  surfaces the approval elicitations the desktop app uses — `applyPatch
  Approval`, `execCommandApproval`, plus the v2 `item/commandExecution/
  requestApproval`, `item/fileChange/requestApproval`, `item/permissions/
  requestApproval`, and `mcpServer/elicitation/request`. Every elicitation
  is mapped to the bridge's generic `requestApproval` round-trip
  (architecture/02a §6.2), so the phone's interactive approval card just
  works for Codex. A user's `approveSession` decision becomes a session-
  wide `approved_for_session`; `approve` → `approved`; `reject` → `denied`.
  Verified end-to-end against `codex-cli` 0.139.0: handshake, turn
  lifecycle, deltas, reasoning, blocks, usage, errors, app-server crash
  mid-turn, `turn/interrupt` cancellation, and the approval elicitations
  (the `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` elicitation round-trips to
  the phone, the bridge replies with the user's decision; an unknown
  elicitation is auto-rejected so the app-server does not hang).
- **Gemini CLI real approvals via the `BeforeTool` hook** — the bridge's
  Gemini adapter now opts into interactive approvals the same way Claude
  Code does, with the same `requestApproval` round-trip the phone already
  speaks (`turn/send { approvalResponse }`). Setting
  `agents['gemini-cli'].interactiveApprovals: true` (gated on `lanEnabled`)
  makes the bridge write `~/.uxnan/hooks/gemini-approval-hook.cjs` (a
  dependency-free Node script that POSTs each `BeforeTool` event to the
  bridge's local HTTP endpoint) AND, per turn, a `<cwd>/.gemini/
  settings.json` with a `BeforeTool` hook pointing at it. `--approval-mode`
  is set to Gemini's `default` ("prompt for approval" in their
  vocabulary); the hook is the gate, NOT a TTY prompt (since `-p` is
  non-interactive). Without the hook the prompt would block the CLI
  forever; the adapter only injects the hook when the LAN endpoint is
  resolvable, otherwise the turn fails with a clear "agent not running"-
  style error. New `permissionMode: 'interactive'` value on
  `GeminiAdapterOptions` (the other modes — `default`/`plan`,
  `acceptEdits`/`auto_edit`, `bypassPermissions`/`yolo` — are unchanged).
  Existing user settings (other hooks, theme, …) are preserved: the
  bridge MERGES its `uxnan-approval` entry under
  `hooks.BeforeTool[*]`. Gemini uses the same hook contract as Claude
  Code (the CLI ships a `gemini hooks migrate` command that imports
  Claude hook settings). Covered by `test/adapters/gemini-adapter.test.ts`
  (mode mapping, env injection, `<cwd>/.gemini/settings.json` write) and
  `test/hooks/gemini-approval-hook.test.ts` (allow/deny/no-URL/
  unreachable paths). **Validated end-to-end against a real
  `gemini -p ... --approval-mode default` run with a fake bridge in the
  loop** — the CLI invoked the hook for both `update_topic` and
  `list_directory` and waited for the response (the bridge received the
  POSTs with the right payload shape). See `bridge/FOR-DEV.md` for the
  per-adapter status; **OpenCode / pi remain documented as gaps** —
  their headless modes don't expose a pre-tool protocol the bridge can
  intercept, so no per-action gate is possible without driving their
  server/RPC entry points (a much bigger refactor; tracked separately).

### Changed
- **Codex real approvals via the `codex app-server` turn protocol** — the
  bridge's Codex adapter is refactored from one-shot `codex exec --json` to
  a **long-lived** `codex app-server` JSON-RPC process. The new path speaks
  the full turn protocol (`initialize` → `thread/start` → `turn/start`) and
  surfaces the approval elicitations the desktop app uses — `applyPatch
  Approval`, `execCommandApproval`, plus the v2 `item/commandExecution/
  requestApproval`, `item/fileChange/requestApproval`, `item/permissions/
  requestApproval`, and `mcpServer/elicitation/request`. Every elicitation
  is mapped to the bridge's generic `requestApproval` round-trip
  (architecture/02a §6.2), so the phone's interactive approval card just
  works for Codex. A user's `approveSession` decision becomes a session-
  wide `approved_for_session`; `approve` → `approved`; `reject` → `denied`.
  Verified end-to-end against `codex-cli` 0.139.0: handshake, turn
  lifecycle, deltas, reasoning, blocks, usage, errors, app-server crash
  mid-turn, `turn/interrupt` cancellation, and the approval elicitations
  (the `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` elicitation round-trips to
  the phone, the bridge replies with the user's decision; an unknown
  elicitation is auto-rejected so the app-server does not hang).

### Changed
- **Codex `permissionMode` default switched from `acceptEdits` to
  `interactive`.** The old default auto-approved every tool via
  `-s workspace-write` (a silent footgun); the new default is the app-
  server's `on-request` + `workspace-write`, so the phone actually gets
  asked. `acceptEdits` is still accepted for back-compat and maps to the
  same no-prompt behavior. New `interactive` mode is the recommended
  production posture; `bypassPermissions` and `default` (read-only)
  unchanged.
- **Agent-manager `requestApproval` return type widened** from
  `'allow' | 'deny'` to the full `ApprovalDecision`
  (`'approve' | 'reject' | 'approveSession'`). The Claude `PreToolUse`
  hook caller (the bridge's local HTTP server) translates the decision to
  `'allow' | 'deny'` for the hook's wire shape; the Codex adapter uses the
  full decision to emit the right `ReviewDecision` kind. The shared
  pending-map is keyed by `approvalId` and a single `respondApproval` call
  resolves both backends.

### Added (earlier)
- **Richer block/tool reconstruction in the on-disk history fallback** —
  `SessionHistoryReader` (`src/conversation/session-history.ts`) now ALSO
  reconstructs the structured MessageContent blocks (`command_execution` /
  `diff` / generic `tool`) the live adapter would have emitted, so the
  phone's Work log and Changed files populate for history-fallback turns the
  same way they do for live turns. Each agent's tool-call entries are
  mapped using the same `*-tools.ts` helpers the live adapter uses, so the
  on-the-wire block shape stays in lock-step:
    - **Claude Code** — pairs `tool_use` (assistant) with the next
      `tool_result` (user) by `tool_use_id`.
    - **Codex** — handles BOTH the legacy `command_execution` /
      `file_change` / `mcp_tool_call` format AND the newer codex-cli 0.98+
      `function_call` + `function_call_output` / `custom_tool_call` +
      `custom_tool_call_output` format (paired by `call_id`). Codex tool
      events AND reasoning items precede the assistant text, so they're
      queued and flushed onto the next assistant message. `shell_command`
      → `command_execution`; `apply_patch` → `diff`; others → generic `tool`.
    - **OpenCode** — reads each message's `tool` parts (already paired
      with their result in the same part) and maps the tool name to a
      structured block (`bash`/`edit`/`write` get typed blocks, others
      → generic `tool`).
    - **pi** — pairs the `toolCall` content block inside an assistant
      message with the subsequent `role:'toolResult'` message (by
      `toolCallId`). The `think` tags embedded in the assistant text
      are extracted into `Message.thinking`.
    - **Gemini CLI** — the `gemini` messages already include `toolCalls`
      with both args and result inline; each one maps to a structured
      block.
  Covered by 12 new unit tests (basic pairing per agent, error exit
  code, reasoning-from-summary, internal-tool filtering, etc.) AND
  smoke-tested against real on-disk agent logs: parsed 44 Gemini blocks
  from one session, 26 OpenCode blocks from another, and 4 Codex blocks
  from a third — all from the actual `~/.gemini/tmp`, `~/.local/share/
  opencode/storage`, and `~/.codex/sessions` directories. `turn/list`
  is unchanged on the wire; the phone now sees structured Work log /
  Changed files for history-fallback turns that previously rendered
  empty.
- **Gemini CLI on-disk session history** — the `SessionHistoryReader`
  (`src/conversation/session-history.ts`) now parses the Gemini CLI's real
  per-snapshot JSON log under `~/.gemini/tmp/<projectHash>/chats/
  session-<ts>-<shortId>.json`, so `turn/list` falls back to the agent's own
  history when the in-memory store is empty (bridge missed the turns,
  `threads.json` was lost, or the session was driven from a terminal). The
  adapter already persists the native session id, so the locator is now wired.
  Per the `gemini-cli` 0.46.0 format: top-level `{ sessionId, projectHash,
  startTime, lastUpdated, messages:[{id, timestamp, type, content, thoughts?}] }`,
  with the 8-char short id in the filename = first 8 hex chars of the UUID
  (dashes stripped). The reader (a) walks every `tmp/<hash>/chats/` dir looking
  for `session-*-<shortId>.json`, (b) keeps ONLY files whose top-level
  `sessionId` matches, (c) merges messages across snapshots deduplicating by
  message `id`, (d) sorts by timestamp, (e) maps `user`→user and `gemini`→
  assistant (skipping `info`/`error`), and (f) joins `thoughts[].description`
  into the assistant message's `thinking` field. The multi-file path cache
  (60s TTL) reuses the resolved file list. Best-effort + read-only: tolerant
  of malformed JSON, returns `null` for unknown/unsupported agents, a
  non-UUID session id, or a missing log. Covered by 7 new tests in
  `test/conversation/session-history.test.ts` (basic, thoughts, multi-part
  content, multi-snapshot merge + dedup, shortId collision, multi-project
  scan, TTL re-scan) AND smoked end-to-end against a real on-disk gemini-cli
  session log (verified parses of all 3 turns with user/gemini messages and
  extracted thinking). `turn/list` is unchanged on the wire; the phone just
  sees history it previously couldn't. Aider remains the only remaining agent
  without an on-disk history reader (its CLI doesn't ship a per-session log —
  follow-up in `FOR-DEV.md`).

### Docs
- **Synced the spec (`architecture/02a-system-architecture.md` and
  `architecture/02b-contracts-and-requirements.md`) with the code.** This
  is a docs-only change in the bridge; no runtime behavior changed. Per
  `AGENTS.md` → *Spec drift control (non-negotiable)*, every `DONE` in
  this monorepo's `FOR-DEV.md` is now reflected in the spec. The spec was
  behind the code (relay was already optional, push was already
  bridge-direct, manual-code pairing was already bridge-first, Aider was
  the only remaining agent, the per-agent `auth/status` was already
  sanitized, etc.). The spec now matches.
  - `architecture/02a-system-architecture.md`: section 2 (topologies, with
    LAN/Tailscale-direct as primary and relay demoted to self-hosted
    fallback); section 3 (`IAgentAdapter` updated with `respondApproval`,
    `listModels` returning `AgentModel[]`, `nativeSessionId`,
    `SendTurnOptions`, `gitRevert`/`gitDeleteBranch`/`gitRemoveWorktree`,
    `browseDirs`, `exists`, and the 5 wired agents listed); section 5.5.3
    (manual-code pairing reframed as bridge-first);
    section 5.5.4 (`PairingPayload` v2 with optional `relay` + `hosts` +
    Base64 UTF-8 JSON encoding); section 5.10 (relay demoted to
    self-hosted; push split into bridge-direct primary + relay fallback).
  - `architecture/02b-contracts-and-requirements.md`: the canonical 59
    JSON-RPC methods (organized by domain: threads/turns 15, git 18,
    workspace 9, projects 2, agents 2, auth 3, notifications 3, bridge
    control 7) + 8 streaming notifications (`stream/turn/started`,
    `stream/message/delta`, `stream/thinking/delta`,
    `stream/content/block`, `stream/turn/completed`, `stream/turn/error`,
    `stream/turn/aborted`, `stream/model/resolved`) + cross-cutting
    shapes (`PairingPayload` v2, `TurnSendParams`, `TurnAttachment`,
    `ApprovalResponse`, `AgentModel`, `AgentCapabilities`, `TurnUsage`,
    `ApprovalRequestBlock`). Obsolete methods removed from the spec
    (with a note for each: `initialize`/`initialized`, `bridge/version`,
    `getAuthStatus`, `account/*`, `project/add`/`remove`,
    `git/branch/create`, `git/worktree/managed/create`,
    `git/stacked/publish`, `thread/turns/list`, `thread/turn/start`,
    `desktop/*`, etc.) — see the spec for the full list with
    replacements.
  - `architecture/00-index.md` (mobile side): implementation status
    table updated to the current state (Neural Expressive, manual-code
    pairing bridge-first, voice, image attachments, per-model run-option
    knobs, context-usage indicator, per-agent `auth/status`, interactive
    approval, full Git, etc.).
- **Updated this monorepo's `README.md`** to reflect the ALPHA state
  (status section, the 5 wired agents, the new push architecture, the
  manual-code pairing + mDNS, the new bridge-control methods, the
  test count).

### Changed
- **Gemini model list is the full `VALID_GEMINI_MODELS` set, plus `auto`.**
  The Gemini CLI has no headless enumerate command (only Codex via
  app-server and OpenCode/pi via their list commands can; Claude Code can't
  either), so `listModels()` returns a hand-kept table sourced from the CLI's
  own constants (`packages/core/src/config/models.ts` in
  google-gemini/gemini-cli): the `auto` routing alias and every id in the
  CLI's `VALID_GEMINI_MODELS` set. The concrete model a run resolves to is
  still surfaced via `model_resolved`. Curated ids:
  - `auto` *(default, → CLI picks the best model)*
  - Pro: `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`,
    `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools`, `gemini-2.5-pro`
  - Flash: `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3-flash`,
    `gemini-2.5-flash`
  - Flash-Lite: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
  - *Experimental* (CLI's `experimentalGemma` flag): `gemma-4-31b-it`,
    `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`
  `git/revert` (creates a revert commit, preserving history),
  `git/deleteBranch` (`git branch -d`, refuses an unmerged branch unless
  `force` → `-D`), `git/removeWorktree` (`git worktree remove`, refuses a dirty
  worktree unless `force` → `--force`, then prunes) in `git-service.ts` +
  `git-handler.ts`; and `workspace/exists` (`workspace-handler.ts`) probing
  whether a thread's `cwd` still exists (folders/worktrees removed outside the
  app). Deletion safety is git's own default; `force` is the explicit override.
  Covered by `git-service.test.ts` + `git-workspace-handlers.test.ts`.
- **Interactive approval intake** — `turn/send` now accepts a control-only
  `approvalResponse: { approvalId, decision }` (no new turn) and routes the
  decision to the agent via `AgentManager.respondApproval` →
  `IAgentAdapter.respondApproval`. Agents request approval by emitting an
  `approval` content block (`approvalBlock()` in `content-blocks.ts`).
  - **Echo dev-agent demo (works now, no real agent):** a turn whose text is
    `approval-demo` emits a sample high-risk approval and PAUSES until the phone
    replies, then completes with the decision — start an **`echo`** thread and
    send `approval-demo` to validate the mobile approval card end-to-end.
  - **Claude Code real approvals (opt-in) — DONE & validated end-to-end** against
    `claude` 2.1.177. Set `agents['claude-code'].interactiveApprovals: true` (needs
    `lanEnabled`): the adapter injects a **`PreToolUse` hook** via
    `--settings … --permission-mode default` so every tool round-trips to the
    bridge's local `POST /agent-hook/approval` endpoint (token-guarded). The
    bridge emits the `approval` block to the phone and **holds** the hook's
    response until the user answers (`turn/send { approvalResponse }`), then the
    hook returns `allow`/`deny` to the CLI. `src/hooks/claude-approval-hook.cjs`
    (written to `~/.uxnan/hooks/`) is the dependency-free hook; fail-safe → deny;
    5-min timeout → deny. Verified live: an allowed Write runs, a denied Write is
    blocked. (Earlier discovery: headless `claude -p` has **no**
    `control_request`/`control_response` channel — the hook is the real path.)
  - **Codex:** real approvals still need the app-server turn protocol
    (`codex exec` is non-interactive) — deferred, see `FOR-DEV.md`.
- **Turn image attachments delivered to the agent** — `turn/send` now accepts
  `attachments: TurnAttachment[]` (inline base64 images the phone picks in the
  composer) and allows an **image-only** message (empty/omitted `text`). The new
  `src/agents/attachments.ts` materializes each image **inside the thread's
  working directory** (`<cwd>/.uxnan-attachments/<turnId>/`) and
  `AgentManager.sendTurn` appends a **cwd-relative** reference to the prompt, so
  **every** file/vision-capable agent CLI (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, pi, Gemini)
  can open it within its sandbox — no per-adapter image handling. Writing under
  the cwd (not the OS temp dir) is required: sandboxed agents (Gemini, Codex
  `workspace-write`, Claude `acceptEdits`) reject a path outside the workspace.
  The dir is removed when the turn ends. The persisted user message stays
  faithful (original text, or a `[N image attachment(s)]` placeholder). Tolerant
  parser drops malformed attachments. Unblocks the mobile "Attach" composer.
  Covered by `test/agents/attachments.test.ts`, `agent-manager.test.ts`,
  `handlers/thread-handlers.test.ts`.
- **Manual-pairing code is shared + always visible** — the code now persists to
  `~/.uxnan/pairing-code.json`, so the **running daemon** (which serves
  `/pair/resolve`) and a separate `qr`/`code` command — or an autostarted,
  console-less daemon — hand out the **same** code (previously the code was
  per-process and the one printed by `qr` never matched the daemon's). `start`
  now **prints the pairing code** under the QR, and a new `uxnan-bridge code`
  command prints just the current code. Covered by `pairing-code-service.test.ts`.
- **Manual-code pairing (bridge-side)** — pair without scanning a QR by trading a
  short code shown on the PC for the pairing payload; reframes the relay's off-LAN
  `/trusted-session/resolve` as a bridge-first feature.
  - **Phase 1 — code + resolve:** `src/pairing/pairing-code-service.ts` issues a
    rotating, expiring (10 min), 8-char Crockford-base32 pairing code (shown by the
    `qr` CLI; `Bridge.currentPairingCode()`). The LAN server is now an `http.Server`
    with the WebSocket transport attached, and serves `GET /pair/resolve?code=<code>`
    — constant-time validated + per-IP rate-limited — returning the full
    `PairingPayload` (the same data the QR carries). The code is a consent gate, not
    a new secret.
  - **Phase 2 — mDNS discovery:** `src/transport/mdns-advertiser.ts` advertises the
    bridge on the LAN via DNS-SD (`_uxnan._tcp.local`, PTR/SRV/TXT/A) so the phone
    discovers it without typing the host. Hand-rolled over `node:dgram`
    (dependency-free — no third-party mDNS stack / native build). Toggle via
    `config.mdnsEnabled` (default true, LAN-only). Best-effort: a failed bind
    degrades silently. Verified with unit tests + a real multicast smoke.
- **Gemini CLI agent adapter** — `@google/gemini-cli` wired as a real agent
  (`src/adapters/gemini-adapter.ts`), driven via `gemini -p --output-format
  stream-json --approval-mode <mode> --skip-trust` (validated live, gemini-cli
  0.45.2). Parses the NDJSON stream for streamed text, paired `tool_use`/`tool_result`
  → structured diff/command/tool blocks (`gemini-tools.ts`, internal `update_topic`
  filtered), and `result.stats` → per-turn token usage (1M context window). Session
  continuity via a generated `--session-id <uuid>` then `--resume <uuid>`; the
  concrete model an alias resolves to (from `stats.models`) is surfaced as
  `model_resolved`. Curated model list (`gemini-2.5-pro`/`flash`/`flash-lite`).
  Approval posture configurable (`default`→`plan`, `acceptEdits`→`auto_edit`,
  `bypassPermissions`→`yolo`). Binary resolved via `resolve-gemini.ts`. Exposed
  through the existing `agent/list`/`agent/models` contract — no mobile change.
- **Per-phone push targeting + prune-on-untrust** — the secure transport now tags
  each request with its session identity (`RequestSession { sessionId, deviceId }`),
  threaded through `router.dispatch` to the handlers, so `notifications/register|
  update|unregister` act on the **requesting** phone instead of a single shared
  "active" session — several concurrent phones each manage their own registration
  (falls back to the active session for single-phone setups). `bridge/removeTrustedDevice`
  now also prunes that device's push registration (`PushService.unregisterDevice`),
  so a revoked phone stops receiving background push immediately instead of lingering.
- **On-disk session history fallback for `turn/list` (§5.8.8)** — when the store
  has no turns for a thread, the bridge now reads the agent's own session log from
  disk so the phone can still show history (e.g. the bridge missed the turns, or
  `threads.json` was lost). New `src/conversation/session-history.ts`
  (`SessionHistoryReader`) parses each agent's real on-disk format — Claude Code
  (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl`), Codex
  (`~/.codex/sessions/.../rollout-*-<sessionId>.jsonl`), OpenCode (JSON
  message/part store under `~/.local/share/opencode/storage`, no SQLite dep) and
  pi (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/<cwd>/*_<sessionId>.jsonl`) — with a 60s path cache.
  To locate the file the agent's native session id is now persisted per thread:
  adapters expose `nativeSessionId(threadId)`, `AgentManager` records it via
  `ThreadStore.setAgentSession` on turn end, and the `turn/list` handler reads it
  through `getHistorySource`. Read-only and tolerant; returns nothing for
  unknown/unsupported agents. `turn/list` is unchanged on the wire.
- **Direct FCM push from the bridge (PRIMARY path; relay optional)** — background
  push is now delivered by the bridge itself over any transport (direct LAN,
  Tailscale, or relay), not only via a hosted relay. New `src/push/push-sender.ts`
  (`createBridgePushSender`) lazily loads `firebase-admin` (FCM HTTP v1) and reads
  the Firebase service account from `UXNAN_FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, defaulting to
  `~/.uxnan/firebase-service-account.json` (plug-and-play, no env var needed).
  `PushService` keeps the real device token and delivers direct-first, falling
  back to the relay `POST /push/notify` only when there's no local credential (or
  `relayEnabled`). `firebase-admin` is an `optionalDependency`: absent creds/module
  degrade to a silent no-op (foreground local notifications still work). Live FCM
  init validated against the real `uxnan-app` service account.

### Fixed
- **Push worked only with the relay enabled** — `register` previously always
  forwarded the token to the relay (and stored only the relay secret), so on the
  relay-off default nothing was stored and background push never fired. It now
  stores the device token locally for the direct path and contacts the relay only
  when that path is actually used.

### Fixed (agent wiring, validated live)
- **pi file edits now show as diffs** — pi's `edit` tool is
  `{ path, edits: [{ oldText, newText }] }` (verified live), not
  `old_string`/`new_string`; the mapper handles the `edits` array, so edits land
  in Changed files instead of an empty block.
- **Codex file changes now show a real per-line diff** — `file_change` reports
  only the path + kind, so the adapter runs `git diff HEAD -- <file>` to get the
  actual `−old/+new` hunks with accurate +/- counts (instead of painting the
  whole file green), falling back to the file's content as additions for new/
  untracked files or non-git dirs. (Caveat: `git diff HEAD` is the change since
  the last commit, so it includes any other uncommitted edits to that file.)
- **Context usage persists across re-open** — a turn's `usage` is now stored on
  its assistant message (`Message.usage`, via `ThreadStore.setUsage`) and
  returned in `turn/list`, so the phone restores the context meter instead of
  resetting it to 0.

### Added
- **Thinking + structured commands/tools/diffs for Codex, pi and OpenCode**
  (extends the Claude Code slices to every agent). A shared `content-blocks.ts`
  defines the `command_execution` / `diff` / generic `tool` block builders, and
  per-agent mappers (`codex-tools.ts`, `opencode-tools.ts`, `pi-tools.ts`)
  translate each CLI's events:
  - **Codex** (`exec --json` items): `reasoning` → thinking; `command_execution`
    → command block; `file_change` → per-file diff blocks; `mcp_tool_call` →
    tool block.
  - **OpenCode** (`run --format json` parts): `reasoning` → thinking (suffix
    deltas); `tool` parts (emitted at their terminal state) → command/diff/tool.
  - **pi** (`-p --mode json`): `thinking_delta` → thinking; tools paired from
    top-level `tool_execution_start` (args) + `tool_execution_end` (result) by
    `toolCallId` → command/diff/tool.

  > **Verified live** against codex-cli 0.139, opencode 1.17.4 and pi 0.79.1 by
  > running real turns and inspecting the JSON. This corrected the initial
  > guesses: OpenCode's event is `tool_use` (not `tool`); Codex `mcp_tool_call`

  > Codex `file_change` carries the path only (no hunk/counts); pi/OpenCode
  > `reasoning` wiring is in place but those probe models didn't emit it.

### Fixed
- **Streamed answer no longer shrinks on re-sync.** On a tool-using turn,
  `claude`'s final `result.result` is often only the last segment of the answer;
  the adapter was storing that, so re-entering a conversation (which re-syncs
  from `turn/list`) dropped the earlier paragraphs. The completed turn now keeps
  the full streamed text (`full`) whenever partials were streamed, falling back
  to `result.result` only when nothing streamed.
- **Context usage reported even when the `result` event omits it.** The Claude
  adapter now also reads `usage` from each `assistant` message and uses the
  latest as a fallback, so the phone's context meter fills in instead of showing
  0 when `result.usage` is absent.

### Added
- **Structured tool / command / diff blocks** (second structured-content slice).
  The Claude adapter (`claude-adapter.ts` + new `claude-tools.ts`) parses the
  `tool_use` blocks from each `assistant` message and pairs them with the
  matching `tool_result` from the following `user` message, mapping them to
  MessageContent JSON: **Bash → `command_execution`**, **Edit/MultiEdit/Write/
  NotebookEdit → `diff`** (synthesized −old/+new hunks with +/- counts), and
  **everything else → a generic `tool`** block (output truncated to 4 KB). The
  `AgentManager` emits each as a new `stream/content/block` notification and
  `ThreadStore.appendBlock` persists it; `Message.blocks` is serialized so it
  survives `turn/list`. Contracts: `AgentStreamEvent 'block'`,
  `StreamNotification.ContentBlock` + `ContentBlockParams`, `Message.blocks?`.
  This is what populates the phone's Work log / Changed files. (Codex/pi next.)
- **Agent "thinking" streamed and persisted** (first structured-content slice).
  The Claude adapter (`claude-adapter.ts`) now parses extended-thinking
  `thinking_delta` blocks from the stream-json output and emits a new
  `thinking` agent event (kept separate from answer text). The `AgentManager`
  forwards it as a new `stream/thinking/delta` notification and accumulates it on
  the assistant message via `ThreadStore.appendThinking`; `Message.thinking` is
  serialized so it survives `turn/list`. Contracts: `AgentStreamEvent` gains
  `'thinking'`, `StreamNotification.ThinkingDelta` + `ThinkingDeltaParams`, and
  `Message.thinking?`. (Codex/pi thinking + structured commands/diffs are the
  next slices.)
- **pi agent wired** (`src/adapters/pi-adapter.ts`, `resolve-pi.ts`, registered in
  `bridge.ts`): drives the `pi` CLI (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) via
  `pi -p --mode json`, parsing its newline-JSON stream (streamed `text_delta`s,
  final text + `usage.totalTokens`, `session` id for `--session-id` continuity,
  `stopReason`/`errorMessage` and plain-text startup errors). Model selection
  (`--model provider/model`), reasoning effort (`--thinking`, advertised per model
  from `pi --list-models`' `thinking` column), and a tool posture
  (`permissionMode`: `acceptEdits` default / `default` read-only / `bypassPermissions`)
  are all wired. Auth detected by `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` existence. Reports
  `reportsContextUsage`. Validated against `pi` 0.79.1.
- **Agents advertise `reportsContextUsage`** (`claude-adapter.ts`,
  `codex-adapter.ts`): Claude and Codex set the new capability flag so the phone
  shows their context meter (at 0 before the first turn); OpenCode leaves it
  false (it reports no usage).
- **Per-model run-option knobs advertised + applied** (`src/adapters/run-options.ts`,
  `claude-adapter.ts`, `codex-adapter.ts`, `opencode-adapter.ts`,
  `agent-manager.ts`, `handlers/thread-context-handler.ts`): `agent/models` now
  advertises a `reasoning` effort enum per model, and `turn/send` accepts the
  chosen values under `options` (mapped to `--effort` / `-c
  model_reasoning_effort=` / OpenCode `--variant`). The legacy flat `effort`
  remains a fallback. The effort levels are the **real per-agent options**:
  **Codex** discovers them per model from the app-server `model/list`
  (`supportedReasoningEfforts` + `defaultReasoningEffort` — so each model offers
  exactly what it supports, e.g. `low/medium/high/xhigh` with the right default;
  the `config.toml` fallback uses a generic set); **Claude** uses the levels its
  `--effort` flag accepts (`low/medium/high/xhigh/max`, verified against `claude
  --help` — `ultrathink`-style keywords are prompt triggers, not effort levels).
  OpenCode advertises no knob yet (its `--variant`s are provider/model-specific,
  enumerated at runtime). Phase 2–3 of the per-model run-options seam (the phone
  renders whatever is advertised, so new levels need no app change).

### Fixed
- **pi model picker no longer empty** (`src/adapters/pi-adapter.ts`, `src/adapters/spawn.ts`):
  `pi --list-models` prints its table to **stderr**, but `listModels()` only read
  stdout, so `agent/models` returned `[]` and the phone's model selector showed no
  models when pi was the agent. The adapter now accumulates **both** stdout and
  stderr before parsing (stdin/stdout split verified against `pi` 0.79.1: `-p --mode
  json` events stay on stdout, so turn streaming is unaffected). `SpawnedProcess`
  gains an optional `stderr` stream.
- **Reasoning effort now reaches Claude Code and Codex** (`src/adapters/claude-adapter.ts`,
  `src/adapters/codex-adapter.ts`): `turn/send`'s `effort` was carried by the
  contract but silently dropped by both adapters (only OpenCode consumed it via
  `--variant`). Claude now passes `--effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max>` and Codex
  passes `-c model_reasoning_effort=<low|medium|high>` (both flags verified against
  the installed CLIs' `--help`). Closes the silent-drop gap with the existing
  `effort` field — phase 1 of "Per-model run options" in `FOR-DEV.md`.

### Added
- **Claude Fable 5 model** (`src/daemon-config.ts`, `src/adapters/claude-adapter.ts`):
  seed Claude Code's picker with `claude-fable-5` ("Fable 5", the new top tier
  above Opus) and map it to a 1M context window in `claudeContextWindow()` so the
  phone shows context usage as a percentage. The `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` aliases
  still cover "latest" for their tiers.
- **`auth/status` sanitized, per-agent** (`src/account-status.ts`,
  `src/handlers/account-handler.ts`): replaces the not-implemented stub with a
  real handler that takes `{ agentId }` and returns a SANITIZED `AuthStatus`
  (`agentId`, `requiresLogin`, `loginInProgress`, `authenticatedProvider?`,
  `transportMode: 'local'`, `platform`) — **never** tokens/keys. Login is detected
  by the EXISTENCE only of each agent's well-known auth file (Codex
  `~/.codex/auth.json`, Claude `~/.claude/.credentials.json`/`~/.claude.json`,
  OpenCode `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`) — contents are never read; an
  agent without a mapping falls back to binary availability, an unknown agent is
  rejected with `-32602`. `AgentManager` gains `isAvailable(agentId)`.
  `auth/login`/`auth/logout` remain stubs (interactive CLI login is a follow-up).
- **Checkpoint retention (prune)** (`src/workspace/checkpoint-service.ts`,
  `src/daemon-config.ts`): each `workspace/checkpoint` now prunes old checkpoints
  beyond a per-project count cap (`checkpointMaxPerProject`, default 25) and/or an
  age TTL (`checkpointTtlDays`, default 0 = off), deleting both the
  `refs/uxnan/checkpoints/*` anchor and the `checkpoints.json` entry — so the set
  no longer grows unbounded.
- **Per-project agent/model pins** (`src/daemon-config.ts`,
  `src/projects/project-registry.ts`, `src/handlers/thread-context-handler.ts`):
  a new `projectAgents: AgentConfig[]` config (each entry's `cwd` identifies the
  project) lets a repo pin a default `agentId`/`model`. `ProjectRegistry` now
  consumes it — `project/list`/`resolve` surface the pin on `Project` and a new
  `agentConfigFor(cwd)` exposes it — and `thread/start` falls back to the pinned
  agent (then the global `defaultAgent`) when the phone omits `agentId`. The
  pinned model only applies when the resolved agent IS the pinned one, so an
  explicit agent override never inherits a foreign model. Consumes the shared
  `AgentConfig` that was previously defined-but-unused.
- **Push registrations persist + multi-session** (`src/push/push-service.ts`,
  `src/bridge.ts`): registrations are now keyed by relay `sessionId` and stored
  to `~/.uxnan/push-state.json` (atomic write), restored at startup via
  `PushService.load()`. Background push therefore survives a bridge restart
  WITHOUT the phone re-registering (the relay still holds its sessionId→token
  map; the bridge only needs `sessionId` + `notificationSecret` to notify). A
  turn-end now pushes to **every** registered phone, so multiple paired devices
  each receive background push. `register`/`updatePreferences`/`unregister` act
  on the active session.
- **`bridge/removeTrustedDevice` implemented** (`src/handlers/bridge-control-handler.ts`):
  revokes a phone's trust (`trustStore.remove`) and drops any live session/sink
  (`sessions.remove` + `sessionRegistry.unregister`) so a removed device is both
  untrusted and disconnected immediately. Idempotent — removing an absent device
  is not an error (the phone deletes locally first and calls this best-effort).
  Previously threw `methodNotImplemented`. Unblocks the device-management UI.
- **Thread lifecycle handlers** (`src/handlers/thread-context-handler.ts` +
  `src/conversation/thread-store.ts`): `thread/rename`, `thread/archive`,
  `thread/unarchive` and `thread/delete` are now wired. `ThreadStore` gains
  `renameThread` / `archiveThread` / `unarchiveThread` (status → `archived` /
  `active`, returning the updated `Thread`) and `deleteThread` (removes the
  thread and its turns, rejecting an unknown id with `-32008`). The mobile app
  already called these best-effort to mirror local changes; they now persist on
  the bridge so archive/rename/delete survive a phone reinstall or a second
  device. Closes the "Thread management" item in `FOR-DEV.md`.

### Changed
- **Checkpoint `apply` is now a true worktree restore**
  (`src/workspace/checkpoint-service.ts`): besides restoring the snapshot's file
  contents (recreating deleted files, overwriting modified ones), it now also
  DELETES files created after the checkpoint, so the working tree matches the
  snapshot exactly — full parity with the mobile `AiChangeSet` revert. Extras are
  detected by snapshotting the current tree into a temp index (HEAD + `add -A`,
  respecting `.gitignore`, leaving the user's real index untouched) and diffing
  snapshot → now; the op stays worktree-only and never removes gitignored files.
- **`bridge/status.relayConnected` reflects the real relay connection**
  (`src/bridge-context.ts`, `src/bridge.ts`, `src/handlers/bridge-control-handler.ts`):
  the handler previously hard-coded `false`. `BridgeContext` now exposes
  `relayConnected()`, backed by the live relay-serve state (`relayState.connected`),
  so the phone's `bridge/status` reports whether a relay session is actually
  serving. `bridge/trustedDevices` also reads through `ctx.trustStore` now.

### Fixed
- **`thread/start` on a browsed folder no longer fails with "unknown project".**
  `src/handlers/thread-context-handler.ts` required `projects.byId(projectId)`
  to resolve, but a directory picked via `workspace/browseDirs` is SYNTHESIZED
  into a project that isn't in `workspaceRoots`, so `byId` threw
  `ResourceNotFound` and the thread was never created — every later `turn/send`
  then failed with `-32008 thread not found`. The phone always sends the chosen
  `cwd`, so use it directly and only resolve the project by id as a cwd fallback
  when none is given. This unblocks the plug-and-play folder-browser flow.

### Changed
- **Relay is off by default** (`daemon-config.ts`): `relayEnabled` now defaults
  to `false`, so a fresh install is LAN/Tailscale-direct with **zero hosting**
  and the pairing QR carries only the direct `hosts`. The relay is **optional
  and self-hosted** — set `relayEnabled: true` + `relayUrl` to your own relay to
  add an off-LAN fallback. Docs updated with how to enable + self-host
  (`docs/connectivity.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `relay/docs/deploy.md`).
- **Directory browsing defaults to the bridge's launch directory** — when no
  `browseRoots`/`workspaceRoots` are configured, `workspace/browseDirs` now
  roots at `process.cwd()` (where the bridge was started) instead of the user's
  home directory, matching `ProjectRegistry`. Zero-config plug-and-play: start
  the bridge in the folder you want the phone to reach and that folder (plus its
  sub-directories) is the root. (`workspace/browse-service.ts`.)

### Added — per-turn token usage
- **Context usage reporting** (`adapters/claude-adapter.ts`,
  `adapters/codex-adapter.ts`, `agents/agent-manager.ts`): Claude parses the
  `result` event's `usage` and reports `tokens` (input + cache + output) with
  the model's context window (Opus/Sonnet 1M, Haiku 200K); Codex sums
  input + output + reasoning tokens from `turn.completed.usage` (no window in
  exec mode). `AgentManager` forwards `usage` onto the `turn/completed`
  notification. Exposes `claudeContextWindow`/`claudeUsageTokens`/`codexUsageTokens`.

### Added — account-aware model discovery for Codex & Claude Code
- **Codex `listModels()`** (`adapters/codex-adapter.ts`): `codex exec` has no
  enumerate command, so the adapter drives the same protocol the desktop app
  uses — spawns `codex app-server` and runs the `initialize` → `model/list`
  JSON-RPC handshake (newline-delimited JSON over stdio). The list is
  account-aware (free vs paid changes it). Falls back to `~/.codex/config.toml`
  (`model` + the `[tui.model_availability_nux]` table) when the app-server is
  unavailable. Exposes `parseCodexModelList` / `parseCodexConfigModels`.
  Verified live against `codex-cli` 0.138 (returned `gpt-5.5` + `gpt-5.4-mini`).
- **Claude Code resolved-version surfacing** (`adapters/claude-adapter.ts`):
  `parseClaudeLine` now extracts `model` from the `system/init` event and the
  adapter emits a `model_resolved` stream event, so the phone can show the
  concrete version an alias mapped to (e.g. `opus` → `claude-opus-4-8`).
  `model_resolved` is forwarded as `stream/model/resolved` by `AgentManager`.

- **Pinned Claude Code models via config** (`daemon-config.ts`,
  `adapters/claude-adapter.ts`): new `agents.<id>.models` setting — an array of
  bare id strings or `{ id, displayName?, description? }` specs — surfaces
  concrete, versioned models in the picker **alongside** Claude Code's stable
  aliases. The aliases now render as `Opus (latest)` / `Sonnet (latest)` /
  `Haiku (latest)`; pinned ids that collide with an alias are dropped.
  `DEFAULT_DAEMON_CONFIG` seeds Claude Code with `claude-opus-4-8`/`-4-7`,
  `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5` so a fresh install shows exact
  versions out of the box. Docs: [`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md),
  [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).
- **Per-agent config merge** (`resolveDaemonConfig`): agent settings are now
  deep-merged one level, so a partial override (e.g. just `permissionMode`)
  preserves seeded defaults like `models` instead of replacing the whole agents
  map. Set an explicit empty value (`models: []`) to clear a seeded default.

### Changed
- **`listModels()` / `agent/models` return structured `AgentModel[]`** instead
  of bare id strings (Claude/OpenCode/Codex adapters + `AgentManager.getModels`).
  Claude exposes the stable aliases with readable labels (`Opus`/`Sonnet`/
  `Haiku`) and a description; OpenCode/Codex carry id + displayName + default.

### Added — direct LAN/Tailscale transport (relay now optional)
- **Advertise direct addresses in the pairing QR**: `src/transport/local-hosts.ts`
  enumerates the bridge's non-internal IPv4s (LAN + a Tailscale `100.x` address) and
  `generatePairingQr` includes them as `hosts`. The phone tries these first and
  falls back to the relay. Verified on a real machine (QR carried the LAN + Tailscale
  addresses).
- **`relayEnabled` config** (`daemon-config.ts`, default `true`): set `false` for a
  pure LAN/Tailscale setup — the bridge skips the relay connection and the QR carries
  only `hosts`. `cli.ts start` prints the direct addresses and only dials the relay
  when enabled.
- This makes **LAN-direct the primary plug-and-play path**, **Tailscale (or any mesh
  VPN) the recommended remote option with no hosting**, and the **hosted relay
  optional**. Docs: [`docs/connectivity.md`](docs/connectivity.md).
- Tests: `localHostPorts` enumeration; QR includes/omits `hosts`/`relay`; shared
  pairing validation for the optional-transport contract.

### Added — autostart (install-service / uninstall-service)
- **`uxnan-bridge install-service` / `uninstall-service`** (`src/service-installer.ts`
  + `src/cli.ts`): register the bridge to start at user logon, **as the logged-in
  user and never elevated** (`node <cli.js> start`; works for a global install or a
  dev checkout). Per platform: Windows Task Scheduler logon task (`/SC ONLOGON /RL
  LIMITED`) with a **hidden Startup-folder `.vbs` fallback** when Task Scheduler is
  denied (restricted accounts/policy — no admin, no console window); macOS LaunchAgent
  (`RunAtLoad`+`KeepAlive`); Linux systemd `--user` unit. `buildServicePlan` is pure
  (unit-tested per platform); execution uses `execFile` (no shell). Validated
  end-to-end on Windows (Task-Scheduler-denied → Startup `.vbs` launches node hidden).
- Tests: per-platform plan shape + the Windows Startup fallback launcher.

### Added — plug-and-play directory browsing
- **`workspace/browseDirs`** (`src/workspace/browse-service.ts` +
  `src/handlers/workspace-handler.ts`): the phone navigates sub-directories under a
  configured base root (e.g. `Documents`), sees which are git repos, and picks ANY
  directory (git or not) as a thread's cwd — no per-project pre-configuration. The
  result includes the list of configured roots (for a root picker), the current
  path/parent (`parent` is `null` at the root — the phone cannot go above it), the
  absolute `cwd` to pass to `thread/start`, and the sub-directories. Confinement
  reuses `resolveWithinRoot` (rejects `..`/absolute escapes; excludes `.git` and
  sensitive names).
- **Config `browseRoots`** (`daemon-config.ts`): absolute base dirs the phone may
  browse; falls back to `workspaceRoots`, then the user's home directory. Exposed
  on `BridgeContext.browse` (`BrowseService`).
- **Security note:** this confines the phone-facing browse/workspace API, NOT the
  agent process — once a directory is chosen, the agent CLI runs there and acts on
  that subtree (writes bounded by each agent's sandbox posture). Documented in
  `FOR-HUMAN.md`.
- Tests: `BrowseService` (root listing, git-repo marking, `.git`/sensitive
  exclusion, descend path/parent/cwd, escape rejection, unknown-root rejection,
  empty-roots fallback).

### Added — Codex agent
- **Codex adapter** (`src/adapters/codex-adapter.ts`): real agent driven by
  `codex exec --json`. Spawns one process per turn with stdin closed (Codex blocks
  on an open stdin pipe), parses its JSONL event stream (`thread.started` /
  `item.completed` `agent_message` / `turn.completed` / `turn.failed`) into bridge
  events, keeps Codex's `thread_id` per thread for `exec resume <id>` continuity,
  and runs in the thread's cwd (`-C`). The prompt is an argv element
  (`shell:false`) — never shell-interpolated. Always passes `--skip-git-repo-check`
  so a thread can run in any directory. Codex emits complete `agent_message` items
  (no token deltas), so each is streamed as one chunk; `turn.completed` finalizes,
  `turn.failed` surfaces as a turn error. Resume continuity validated live against
  `codex-cli` 0.137.
- **Binary resolution** (`src/adapters/resolve-codex.ts`): runs the npm
  `@openai/codex/bin/codex.js` entry via `node` (keeps `shell:false`; the entry
  locates the right native binary), or the `codex` launcher on PATH.
- **Configurable headless sandbox posture** (reuses `AgentSettings.permissionMode`):
  `acceptEdits` (default — `-s workspace-write`), `default` (`-s read-only`), or
  `bypassPermissions` (`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`).
- Codex is registered in `startBridge` alongside OpenCode and Claude Code and
  exposed via `agent/list`; no shared-contract or mobile change was needed (the
  `'codex'` AgentId already existed). Codex's `app-server`/`exec-server`/
  `mcp-server` modes are **not** used — `codex exec` is the one-shot entry point.
- Tests: Codex parser + adapter (delta/complete/error/thread resume, sandbox-flag
  mapping).

### Added — Claude Code agent
- **Claude Code adapter** (`src/adapters/claude-adapter.ts`): real agent driven by
  `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages`.
  Spawns one process per turn with stdin closed, parses its JSONL event stream
  (`system`/`stream_event` `content_block_delta` `text_delta`/`assistant`/`result`)
  into bridge events, keeps Claude's `session_id` per thread for `--resume`
  continuity, and runs in the thread's cwd. The prompt is an argv element
  (`shell:false`) — never shell-interpolated. Token deltas stream from
  `text_delta`; if no partials arrive, the complete `assistant` message is emitted
  as one chunk; the terminal `result` carries the authoritative final text (or
  surfaces `is_error` as a turn error). `listModels()` exposes the stable `--model`
  aliases (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) since Claude Code has no enumerate command.
- **Binary resolution** (`src/adapters/resolve-claude.ts`): prefers the native
  installer binary at `~/.local/bin/claude[.exe]`, then the npm-global
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code/cli.js` run via `node` (keeps `shell:false`), then the
  `claude` launcher on PATH.
- **Configurable headless permission posture** (`AgentSettings.permissionMode`):
  `acceptEdits` (default — file edits auto-apply, other tools stay gated),
  `default` (no flag), or `bypassPermissions` (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`).
- Claude Code is registered in `startBridge` alongside OpenCode and exposed via
  `agent/list` / `agent/models`; no shared-contract or mobile change was needed
  (the `'claude-code'` AgentId already existed).
- Shared spawn helper extracted to `src/adapters/spawn.ts` (reused by the OpenCode
  and Claude Code adapters).
- Tests: Claude parser + adapter (delta/complete/error/session continuity,
  assistant-message fallback, permission-flag mapping, model aliases).

### Changed — test runner
- `npm test` now runs with `--test-concurrency=1` (serialized) to avoid
  CPU-starvation flakes in the bridge end-to-end tests on Windows: several suites
  boot a full bridge and/or spawn real child processes (git, fake agents), and
  running them in parallel starved the conversation tests' `waitFor` polling. The
  `waitFor` guards were also raised to 30s as a backstop.

### Added — Phase 5b (real OpenCode agent + agent/project selection)
- **OpenCode adapter** (`src/adapters/opencode-adapter.ts`): real agent driven by
  `opencode run --format json`. Spawns one process per turn with stdin closed
  (OpenCode blocks on an open stdin pipe), parses its NDJSON event stream
  (`step_start`/`text`/`step_finish`/`error`), keeps the OpenCode `sessionID` per
  thread for `--session` continuity, and runs in the thread's cwd. The prompt is
  an argv element (`shell:false`) — never shell-interpolated. `resolve-opencode.ts`
  locates the native `opencode.exe` on Windows. OpenCode is now the default agent.
- **Per-thread agent + project selection**: `thread/start` accepts
  `{ agentId, model, cwd }` and persists them; `turn/send` drives the thread's
  agent/model in its cwd. `ProjectRegistry` + real `project/list`/`project/resolve`
  from `config.workspaceRoots` (fallback: the bridge cwd). `agent/list` exposes
  registered agents, capabilities and availability.
- **Agent model discovery**: `agent/models` runs `opencode models` and parses the
  provider/model ids (`OpenCodeAdapter.listModels()` → `AgentManager.getModels()`;
  `IAgentAdapter.listModels` is optional, returns `[]` for agents without it).
- **Change a thread's model mid-conversation**: `thread/setModel`
  (`ThreadStore.setModel` + `thread-context-handler.ts`) repoints the thread's
  `model`; subsequent `turn/send`s use it.
- **Config**: `defaultAgent` (now `opencode`), `workspaceRoots`, per-agent
  `agents.<id>.{binaryPath,model}`.
- Tests: OpenCode parser + adapter (delta/complete/error/session continuity),
  `ProjectRegistry`, `agent/list`, project-scoped `thread/start`.

### Added — Phase 6 (push notifications, gated)
- **Push bridge** (`src/push/push-service.ts`): `notifications/register|update|
  unregister` handlers (`src/handlers/notifications-handler.ts`) register the FCM
  token with the relay; `AgentManager`'s `onTurnEnd` hook pushes a turn-end
  notification, and `session-handler.ts` marks the active relay session as the
  push target. End-to-end push stays **gated** behind relay-side Firebase creds
  (`config.push*`); the bridge no-ops cleanly without them. Follow-ups (FOR-DEV):
  persist the registration to `~/.uxnan/push-state.json`; multi-session support.

### Changed
- **Stable pairing session** (`src/bridge.ts`, `daemon-state.ts`): the pairing
  `sessionId` is persisted to `~/.uxnan/pairing-session.json` and reused across
  restarts (was a fresh UUID each boot), so a trusted phone keeps reconnecting to
  the same session.
- **Relay connection stays alive across phone reconnects** (`connectRelay` in
  `src/bridge.ts`): a background loop serves one phone session, then immediately
  re-arms on the relay — trusted-reconnect works without re-scanning a QR.

### Added — Phase 7 (ops & packaging)
- **File logging** (`src/logger.ts` `createFileLogger`): daily-rotated logs at
  `~/.uxnan/logs/bridge-YYYY-MM-DD.log` with a secret-redaction pass
  (`redactSecrets`: JWTs, `token=`/`secret=` values, PEM key blocks). `startBridge`
  now logs to file + stderr. Logging never throws.
- **Autostart scripts**: real `scripts/install-service-{windows.ps1,macos.sh,
  linux.sh}` (Task Scheduler / LaunchAgent / systemd user unit).
- **npm packaging**: `repository` + `prepublishOnly` on all packages; publish
  checklist (publish `@uxnan/shared` first, pin the `*` deps) in FOR-DEV.md.

### Added — Phase 5 (conversation engine + agent adapters)
- **Conversation store** (`src/conversation/thread-store.ts`): persistent
  threads → turns → messages in `~/.uxnan/threads.json`, with serialized
  mutations.
- **Real thread/turn handlers** (`thread/list|read|start|resume|fork`,
  `turn/list|read|send|cancel`) replacing the stubs.
- **AgentManager** (`src/agents/agent-manager.ts`): routes `turn/send` to an
  adapter, persists the streamed reply, and broadcasts `stream/*` notifications
  to connected phones.
- **Adapter framework**: `ProcessAgentAdapter` (drives a CLI over newline-JSON
  stdio) and a working `EchoAgentAdapter` reference agent that exercises the full
  turn pipeline end-to-end. Codex/OpenCode are `ProcessAgentAdapter` subclasses
  (metadata only — their real CLI protocol is FOR-DEV) and are not wired by
  default; only `echo` is registered.
- Tests: thread-store CRUD/pagination, AgentManager + echo end-to-end,
  ProcessAgentAdapter against a fake agent, and a router-level
  `thread/start` → `turn/send` flow.

### Added — Phase 4b (workspace checkpoints)
- `workspace/checkpoint`, `workspace/diffCheckpoint`, `workspace/applyCheckpoint`
  (`src/workspace/checkpoint-service.ts`). A checkpoint snapshots the whole
  working tree — tracked changes AND untracked files — without touching the
  user's index (temp `GIT_INDEX_FILE` + `commit-tree`), anchored under
  `refs/uxnan/checkpoints/<id>` and recorded in `~/.uxnan/checkpoints.json`.
  `diff` returns the unified diff + per-file status; `apply` restores file
  contents via `git restore`. Unknown ids → `-32008`.
- Limitations (see FOR-DEV.md): `apply` restores contents but does not delete
  files created after the checkpoint; snapshot commits use a fixed internal
  identity and are never pushed.

### Added — Phase 4 (real Git + Workspace handlers)
- **Git handlers** (`src/git/`): `git/status`, `git/diff`, `git/commit`,
  `git/push`, `git/pull`, `git/checkout`, `git/createBranch`,
  `git/createWorktree`, run via `child_process.execFile` (no shell → no command
  injection). Failures map to `-32003 GitOperationFailed`; git output is stripped
  of the project cwd and home dir before being sent to the phone.
- **Workspace handlers** (`src/workspace/`): `workspace/readFile` (utf-8 or
  base64 for binaries), `workspace/readImage`, `workspace/list`,
  `workspace/applyPatch`. All access is **confined to the project root**
  (path-traversal → `-32004 WorkspaceAccessDenied`), the `.git` directory and
  sensitive files (`.env`, keys, credentials) are denied/excluded, and returned
  paths are relative — never absolute (§5.8.9). Read size caps: 5 MB / 10 MB.
- Untrusted-param validators (`src/handlers/params.ts`) reject bad types and
  option-injection (leading `-`) in git refs/paths.

### Added — Phase 3 (identity persistence + pairing hardening)
- **OS-keychain identity persistence** (`KeyringSecretStore`) via the optional
  `@napi-rs/keyring` native module (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain,
  Linux Secret Service). `createDefaultSecretStore()` uses it by default and
  falls back to an in-memory store (with a warning) when the keychain is
  unavailable, so the daemon still runs. The Ed25519 identity now survives
  restarts — a prerequisite for real pairing.
- **Single-instance lock** (`LockFile`, `~/.uxnan/bridge.lock`): `start` refuses
  to launch if another live daemon holds the lock; stale locks (dead pid) are
  taken over. `stop` reads the lock and signals the running daemon (SIGTERM).
- Pairing QR now matches the mobile contract end-to-end (Base64 JSON; the fix
  lives in `@uxnan/shared`).

### Added — Phase 2b (bridge → phone notifications + outbound buffer)
- `SessionRegistry`: tracks the live encrypted sink per connected device so the
  bridge can push JSON-RPC notifications (e.g. streamed agent events).
- `OutboundMessageBuffer`: sliding-window buffer (spec caps
  MAX_BRIDGE_OUTBOUND_MESSAGES / _BYTES) for messages sent while a device is
  offline; flushed in FIFO order on (re)connect.
- `bridge.notify(deviceId, method, params)` and `BridgeContext.sessionRegistry`
  for handlers/managers to push to a phone; returns whether it was sent live or
  buffered.
- Tests: buffer eviction caps, registry buffer→flush, and an end-to-end
  `bridge.notify` delivered to and decrypted by a connected phone.

### Clarified
- `mac` / `iphone` are protocol ROLE names, not platforms. The bridge and relay
  run on Windows, macOS and Linux (developed/tested on Windows); the mobile role
  covers Android and iOS.

### Added — Phase 2 (live E2EE transport + relay)
- **Secure transport** (`src/transport/`) implementing the bridge (server) side
  of the E2EE protocol, interoperable byte-for-byte with the mobile app:
  - `crypto.ts`: X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 key derivation, AES-256-GCM
    encrypt/decrypt, Ed25519 verification — all via `node:crypto` (no external
    crypto deps).
  - `server-handshake.ts`: clientHello → serverHello → clientAuth → ready, with
    transcript signing/verification and `qr_bootstrap` / `trusted_reconnect`.
  - `secure-channel.ts`: AES-256-GCM envelopes with 1-based outbound seq and
    replay-protected inbound seq.
  - `session-handler.ts`: decrypts envelopes, dispatches JSON-RPC through the
    router, returns encrypted responses.
  - `relay-client.ts` / `lan-server.ts`: live `ws` transports (relay `mac`
    connection and direct-LAN server), adapted via a shared `MessageIO`.
  - `trust-store.ts`: trusted-phone persistence (`trusted-phones.json`),
    written on `qr_bootstrap` and read by `bridge/trustedDevices`.
- `startBridge` now exposes `connectRelay(sessionId)` and `startLan()`; the CLI
  `start` boots the LAN server and connects to the relay for a pairing session.
- Depends on the new `uxnan-relay` package for end-to-end tests.
- Tests: crypto round-trips, secure-channel replay/seq, an in-memory two-party
  handshake, a real-WebSocket LAN exchange, and a full phone ↔ relay ↔ bridge
  end-to-end (handshake + encrypted `bridge/status`). 33 bridge tests total.

### Added — Phase 1 (skeleton)
- Initial bridge daemon **skeleton** (TypeScript, ESM, Node ≥18).
- Daemon state under `~/.uxnan/` with atomic JSON writes (`DaemonState`) and
  config defaults/merge (`DaemonConfig`, `resolveDaemonConfig`).
- Ed25519 identity (`SecureDeviceState`) with a pluggable `SecretStore`
  (in-memory implementation) and message signing.
- JSON-RPC `HandlerRouter` with envelope validation and typed error mapping
  (unknown → -32601, malformed → -32600, `RpcError` → its code, other → -32603).
- Real bridge-control handlers (`bridge/status`, `bridge/generatePairingQr`,
  `bridge/connectedPhones`, `bridge/trustedDevices`, `bridge/disconnectPhone`).
- Stub handlers for git/workspace/thread/project/account domains (clear,
  greppable `FOR-DEV` not-implemented errors).
- Pairing QR generation (`generatePairingPayload`, `renderPairingQr`).
- Agent adapter base class plus Codex and OpenCode stubs.
- `uxnan-bridge` CLI: `start`, `status`, `qr`, `stop`, `install-service`, `help`.
- In-memory session registry, bridge status snapshot, leveled logger.
- Tests (node:test): daemon state, identity (sign/verify), router, QR, and an
  end-to-end `startBridge` wiring test.

### Deferred (see FOR-DEV.md)
- Outbound buffer + catch-up on reconnect; key rotation / epoch advance.
- OS-keychain-backed identity persistence (required before real pairing).
- Real git/workspace/thread/account handlers and Codex/OpenCode adapters.
- Daemon process manager (`stop`), autostart scripts, file logging.
- Relay hardening (rate limiting, pairing-code resolution, push endpoints).

### Notes
- Built on TypeScript (the architecture sketches `.js`); same file names, `.ts`
  sources compiled to `dist/`. Justified by end-to-end type-safety with the
  `@uxnan/shared` contracts.
- The bridge identity is in-memory only this increment, so no secret is written
  to disk in plaintext (per AGENTS.md security rules).
