# FOR-DEV — uxnan-bridge

Deferred developer work for the bridge. Each item has a greppable `FOR-DEV:`
marker at its site in the code. (Distinct from `FOR-HUMAN.md`, which tracks assets
only a human can provide.)

> **How to run/validate everything** (automated tests, real-mobile E2EE interop,
> adapter wiring, contract re-checks) is in [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).
> The implemented surface is documented in [`README.md`](README.md) +
> [`docs/`](docs/). **`## Status` below is this component's canonical
> implementation status** (the root `AGENTS.md` points here instead of keeping
> its own inventory); everything after it tracks what's left to build.

## Status

The bridge is **alpha-functional** on its primary path (LAN/Tailscale-direct,
standalone). It builds clean and the suite is green (bridge 689, shared 36, relay
30). The **npm releases shipped** — `uxnan-bridge` is published to npm; releases
publish to the **`latest`** dist-tag (`@uxnan/shared` pinned to the same version by
the release workflow). Nothing below blocks LAN/Tailscale-direct use; the remaining
release follow-ups are the post-publish *Packaging* hardening items and real-device
push validation (FOR-HUMAN).

**Implemented (DONE):**

- **E2EE transport** — relay `mac` client + direct-LAN `http+ws` server,
  handshake, AES-256-GCM channel, byte-for-byte compatible with the mobile app;
  background reconnect loop; stable pairing session; mDNS discovery
  (`_uxnan._tcp.local`) with explicit per-IPv4 membership/announcements on
  multi-homed hosts; manual-code pairing (`GET /pair/resolve?code=`); the LAN
  `qr_bootstrap` handshake is gated on an operator-armed pairing window
  (`PairingCodeService.arm`/`isArmed`, 3-minute TTL, in-memory) — showing the QR
  or the manual code arms it, so a reachable LAN/Tailscale device cannot
  self-enroll as trusted outside that window; `trusted_reconnect` is unaffected.
- **OS-keychain identity persistence** + single-instance lock.
- **Real Git + Workspace handlers** — path-traversal-safe; working-tree
  checkpoints with **true restore** + retention pruning; `git/revert`,
  `git/deleteBranch`, `git/removeWorktree`, `workspace/exists`,
  `workspace/browseDirs`.
- **Conversation engine** — threads / turns + streaming, per-thread
  `Message.blocks` / `Message.thinking` / `Message.usage`, plus the ordered
  `Message.segments` interleave (text runs + work-log/diff/tool blocks in
  production order) so a `turn/list` re-sync renders the work log inline with
  the response instead of stacking all activity above one merged paragraph.
  Parallel-activity blocks (e.g. a Claude Code subagent's tool landing while the
  main text streams) are flagged `beforeText` and slotted BEFORE the open text
  run — in the store and on the `stream/content/block` wire — so a text run is
  never severed mid-word, live and re-synced order always match, and subagent
  text/usage never folds into the main message.
  Native assistant envelopes from Codex, Claude and pi are separated by durable
  `assistant_response_boundary` blocks; terminal text is reconciled additively,
  so an agent's final item cannot erase progress/commentary already shown.
- **Conversation naming** — a thread is no longer labelled with the first ~72
  characters of its opening message (two conversations that start with the same
  phrase were indistinguishable). No agent CLI exposes a title — every one of
  them leaves that to its own client — so the bridge names its own: provisional
  from the opening message, then the agent writes a real one once the first turn
  has an answer, as a **one-shot with no session id** (nothing enters the
  thread's history) on the agent's **cheapest** model. Wired for all seven
  agents, **six verified live**; a generated title never overwrites one the user
  chose (`Thread.titleSource`), and `stream/thread/renamed` converges every
  client. Best-effort throughout: a failure keeps the provisional name.
- **Per-thread message queue** — a `turn/send` arriving with a turn in flight is
  queued (status `queued`) instead of clobbering it, and drains automatically on
  completion; run options are frozen at queue time; the queue holds after a stop
  or a failure until `queue/resume`/`queue/clear`; `turn/cancel` on a queued turn
  marks it `cancelled` without ever reaching an adapter; capped at 10; live state
  surfaced on `turn/list` + `stream/queue/updated`, and turns left `queued` by a
  previous run are cancelled at startup. This is also what enforces one turn per
  thread — the bridge previously started a second turn on top of the first.
- **Mid-turn delivery** — where the agent's CLI has an input channel while it
  works, a follow-up does not wait for the turn: it is handed straight to the
  running one (`IAgentAdapter.steerTurn`), the turn goes `delivered` (terminal
  and *successful*, distinct from `cancelled`) and `stream/turn/delivered`
  fires. Live-verified for **Claude Code** (`--input-format stream-json`, prompt
  and follow-ups on an open stdin), **OpenCode** (`prompt_async` on the busy
  session) and **pi** (`--mode rpc`, `steer` command); implemented for **Codex**
  (`turn/steer`) but not yet run against a
  real turn (see below). Antigravity, Zero and Grok have no such channel and
  keep waiting — Zero's own TUI behaves that way too. Advertised as
  `features.midTurnDelivery` + per-agent `AgentCapabilities.steering`, and every
  refusal falls back to the queue, so a message is never lost.
- **7 active real agents wired** — OpenCode (default), Claude Code, Codex, pi,
  Antigravity (Google's `agy`), Zero, and Grok. Each active integration drives
  its **official local CLI** with
  `shell:false`, parses the native stream, and emits structured
  `stream/content/block` events (command / diff / tool) plus
  `stream/thinking/delta` (reasoning). Most spawn the CLI over stdio; the
  server-based adapters run a local server process instead — **Codex**
  JSON-RPC over `codex app-server` stdio (one process per turn: Codex holds a
  single writer per thread, so the bridge lets go between turns and the same
  conversation opens in the Codex app — see
  [`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md)), **Zero** and **Grok** JSON-RPC over the
  Agent Client Protocol (`zero acp` / `grok agent stdio`, NDJSON over stdio —
  reusing the Codex NDJSON transport, with **real `session/request_permission`
  approvals**), and **OpenCode** HTTP + SSE over `opencode serve` (loopback). No
  further agent is planned right now.
- **Context compaction markers** — real native signals from Codex, Claude,
  OpenCode and pi are normalized into durable `compaction` content blocks.
  Zero/Grok ACP and Antigravity expose no trustworthy signal, so no event is
  inferred for them.
- **Per-thread agent/project selection** + per-project agent/model pins
  (`projectAgents` config); per-model run-option knobs advertised on
  `agent/models`; per-turn token usage on `stream/turn/completed`.
- **Agent commands** — `agent/commands` discovery + `turn/send` `command`
  invocation. Custom prompt-template commands (Codex/OpenCode) are scanned
  and expanded by the bridge (`command-scan.ts`); native control commands run via
  the CLI's own mechanism — Claude Code (`slash_commands` from `system/init` ∪
  curated built-ins ∪ `.claude/commands`, sent as `/name args` with `--resume`)
  and the ACP agents Zero/Grok (`available_commands_update` → `session/prompt`).
  `capabilities.commands` flags the five command-capable adapters; `pi` has none.
- **Full thread lifecycle** — `thread/rename|archive|unarchive|delete`.
- **Plug-and-play folder browsing** — `workspace/browseDirs` with a
  `browseRoots` config.
- **Cross-worktree file-link resolution** — `workspace/resolveFileLink` turns a
  path an agent cited into the viewer's `cwd + path`, picking the target's own
  Git root when the file lives outside the conversation's worktree.
- **Managed worktree locations** — `git/createWorktree` no longer requires a
  `path`: without one the bridge places the worktree itself
  (`git/worktree-location.ts`), under the same layout the desktop resolves in
  `worktreeloc.rs` — by default `<home>/uxnan/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`,
  switchable per install (`worktrees` config) to the legacy
  `<repo>--<branch>` sibling or to a root of the operator's own. The group is
  measured from the repository's **main** worktree, branch names are folded into
  folder names valid on every OS, a taken destination takes the next free
  suffix, and two projects sharing a folder name get separate groups (one pinned
  digest, identical on both sides). Advertised as `features.managedWorktrees`;
  the ones the bridge placed are recorded in `managed-worktrees.json`.
- **Direct FCM push from the bridge** — primary path, persisted across restarts,
  per-phone target, prune-on-untrust. `firebase-admin` is an `optionalDependency`
  (no creds = silent no-op; foreground local notifications still work).
- **Sanitized per-agent `auth/status`** — never tokens; login detected by
  auth-file existence only.
- **Interactive approval intake** — Echo demo + Claude Code opt-in `PreToolUse`
  hook + Codex via the `codex app-server` turn protocol + OpenCode via
  `opencode serve` `permission.asked` + Zero and Grok
  via ACP `session/request_permission`; all routed through one `requestApproval`
  round-trip, validated end-to-end.
- **Image attachments** — CLI-agnostic file-path, sandbox-safe (written into the
  directory the CLI actually runs in — the turn's `cwd`, else the adapter's —
  and referenced relatively, since every agent refuses a path outside its
  workspace). Accepted by every wired agent (`capabilities.images`) except the
  echo demo; see `docs/agents.md` → *Image attachments*.
- **Native-session `turn/list` convergence** for Claude, Codex, OpenCode, pi,
  Zero and Grok. Every idle read merges completed native-only turns into the
  bridge store; OpenCode uses its official local server endpoint and the other
  agents use their persisted transcripts.
- **Bridge control** — `bridge/status` (real `relayConnected`),
  `bridge/removeTrustedDevice` (revokes + drops session + prunes push
  registration), `bridge/trustedDevices`, `bridge/connectedPhones`,
  `bridge/generatePairingQr`.
- **Durable global profile metrics** — the version-2 `metrics.json` ledger keeps
  conversations, message/day buckets, reported tokens, sessions and Git actions
  independently of mutable thread deletion; startup backfills legacy threads,
  complete same-PC export/import is idempotent, and five rotating local
  generations recover an unreadable primary.
- **Autostart** (`install-service` / `uninstall-service` per platform, never
  elevated), file logging with secret redaction, and the
  `start`/`stop`/`status`/`qr`/`code`/`install-service` CLI.

## Profile metrics

- [ ] **Per-phone activity profiles.** The implemented ledger is deliberately
      global per bridge PC: every authenticated phone receives the same complete
      PC snapshot. Individual profiles would enable personal stats on a shared PC
      and clean multi-phone comparisons, but they also require attributing every
      conversation/turn/token/session/Git row to a stable profile. Implement this
      in `src/metrics/metrics-store.ts` and the `metrics/*` handlers only after a
      separate profile identity and explicit recovery/rebinding flow are designed.
      Do **not** use IMEI/Android ID/IDFV or clone the phone's Ed25519 transport
      identity: hardware/platform ids are restricted and unstable, while copied
      trust keys would weaken revocation. The change will need ledger migration,
      authenticated device-to-profile mapping, lost/reinstalled-phone recovery,
      revocation behavior, `shared/` contract additions, and mobile UI/aggregation
      rules. See the inline `FOR-DEV:` marker beside `MetricsEvents`.

## Transport & connectivity

- [ ] **Bind LAN `qr_bootstrap` to a pairing-code proof.** The armed pairing
      window (`server-handshake.ts`, gated on `PairingCodeService.isArmed`) stops
      a reachable device from self-enrolling *outside* the window, but during the
      window any device that reaches the LAN socket still qualifies — it isn't
      required to prove it actually holds the QR/code. Closing that gap needs a
      phone-computed `pairingProof` (e.g. `HMAC-SHA256(pairingCode,
      serverNonce||clientNonce)`) added to `clientAuth`, verified constant-time on
      the bridge before `trustStore.upsert`. **Not done yet** because the mobile
      app has no path to carry a pairing code that far: `ManualPairingService`
      only uses the code to call `GET /pair/resolve` and returns the resulting
      `PairingPayload` — the code itself is discarded before
      `SessionCoordinator.processPairingPayload`/`SecureTransportLayer.performHandshake`
      run, so there's nothing to thread into a proof for the manual-code flow.
      Worse, the QR-scan flow (the primary pairing path) never carries a code at
      all — `PairingPayload` has no such field — so a phone that pairs by
      scanning has no shared secret to compute a proof from under the current
      wire contract. Landing this needs BOTH: (1) mobile-side plumbing to retain
      the code past the initial resolve call, and (2) very likely a `shared/`
      change to embed an equivalent secret in the QR payload too (so QR-scan
      pairing isn't left out), which is its own independently-reviewable change.
      See the `FOR-DEV:` marker in `server-handshake.ts` (`qr_bootstrap` branch).
- [ ] **Cross-process arming for the QR-reprint path on a headless daemon.** The
      armed window is in-memory and per-`PairingCodeService`-instance by design (a
      restart re-requires arming). Two of the three flows are covered: `uxnan-bridge
      start` arms and serves LAN connections from the SAME process, and the
      **manual-code** flow works against a separate, console-less daemon because a
      successful `GET /pair/resolve` arms the daemon that serves it (proving the
      code was read off the PC is the operator action — see `resolve()` in
      `pairing-code-service.ts`). Still open: `uxnan-bridge qr` run as a
      **separate**, short-lived process to reprint the QR for an already-running
      autostarted daemon (see the comment on `cmdQr` in `cli.ts`) only arms THAT
      process. A phone that **scans** that QR goes straight to the handshake without
      ever calling `/pair/resolve`, so the daemon is never armed and the bootstrap is
      rejected as "pairing is not open". Fix by adding an explicit `bridge pair
      --arm` (or similar) command that signals the running daemon directly (e.g.
      over its existing local HTTP surface, or a small shared-state file next to
      `pairing-code.json` that `isArmed()` also consults) rather than silently
      defaulting the window open. Workaround today: pair with the manual code.
- [ ] **Key rotation / keyEpoch advance** — blocked on a mobile trigger. (Seq-based
      catch-up on reconnect is done end-to-end; only key rotation remains.)
- [ ] **Per-direction HKDF session keys** (would retire the AAD direction byte).
      Today one derived key serves both directions, and reflection is prevented by
      binding a direction byte into the envelope AAD (`buildEnvelopeAad`, spec
      §5.9.1). Deriving a distinct key per direction is the cleaner primitive: it
      makes reflection impossible by construction instead of by a bound field, and
      removes the `ChannelRole` parameter that currently exists only so tests can
      stand up a direction-correct counterparty. Deferred, not forgotten — it
      changes key derivation on BOTH sides, so it needs a coordinated
      bridge+mobile change and another `SECURE_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bump.
- [ ] **Reverse-direction cross-language crypto vector.** The committed AAD interop
      vector proves **Node-encrypt → Dart-decrypt** only. `EnvelopeCrypto.encrypt`
      already accepts a fixed `nonce:` for tests, so a Dart test that encrypts the
      same inputs and asserts the exact ciphertext/tag would close the loop in one
      test. Low effort, meaningful coverage — the two sides being mutually
      undecryptable is the single worst failure mode of this transport.
- [ ] **Bind the LAN server to chosen interface(s)** — today it binds all
      interfaces (good for Tailscale). Advertised hosts already EXCLUDE host-only
      virtual adapters (Hyper-V/WSL/Docker/VirtualBox/VMware) via
      `isVirtualInterfaceName` in `local-hosts.ts`, so the phone no longer burns a
      connect timeout on a dead `172.x` virtual-NIC address. Remaining (optional):
      let the user restrict which interfaces are *served* (bound), and let them
      whitelist an unusual advertised address the name-based filter would skip.

## Handlers

- [ ] **Checkpoints on an unborn branch** — `capture` requires at least one commit
      (no HEAD → `-32003`). Support checkpoints on an unborn branch if a use case
      appears. Low priority.
- [ ] **Interactive approvals — pi gap.** pi's headless mode (`pi -p --mode json`)
      runs tools autonomously and emits tool events only **after** the tool ran — no
      pre-tool channel to gate them, so pi surfaces `autonomous: true` (chip + banner)
      instead of approvals. Echo + Claude (`PreToolUse` hook) + Codex (`app-server`) +
      OpenCode (`opencode serve` `permission.asked`) +
      Zero (`zero acp` `session/request_permission`) all have real per-action
      approvals. Real pi approvals would need its `--mode rpc`
      (two-way, adapter refactor); revisit when pi ships a stable pre-tool channel on
      a headless entry point.
- [ ] **OpenCode access-mode — mid-thread per-turn re-apply.** The thread's
      `accessMode` is mapped to a permission ruleset and passed on `POST /session`
      (`opencode-adapter.ts` `#rulesetFor`), so it governs an OpenCode thread from its
      first turn. A mid-thread access-mode change does NOT recreate the session, so
      the new posture only applies to threads started after the change. Resolve by
      confirming whether `opencode serve` accepts a per-turn permission override
      (or `PATCH /session/{id}`), or recreate the session when the mode changes.
      (Codex no longer has this caveat: every turn re-attaches with
      `thread/resume`, which carries the current posture.)
- [ ] **Claude/Codex approval follow-ups** — map `approveSession` to a real
      session-scoped allow on the Claude hook path (today every tool re-asks; Codex's
      app-server already remembers `approved_for_session`); a per-turn allow-list so
      repeated identical tools aren't re-prompted; document that the Claude
      hook URL needs the LAN port resolved (handled by the lazy `url()` after
      `startLan`, but worth a note).
- [ ] **Image attachments — follow-ups** — native per-CLI image input (a dedicated
      flag / MCP image part) where richer than a cwd-relative file path; add
      `.uxnan-attachments/` to a recommended `.gitignore` (cleaned per turn, but a
      crash mid-turn could leave one). **Delivery itself is verified**: a
      four-quadrant probe image was described correctly by `claude -p`,
      `agy -p`, `grok --print`, `pi -p` and `opencode run` (the last two via
      their file tools rather than vision), and by **Codex on-device** through
      the phone. **Zero** takes them natively (inline ACP image block) — unit
      tested, but not yet run end to end because the account is credit-blocked.
- [ ] **`auth/login` / `auth/logout`** — still stubs (driving a CLI's interactive
      login/logout). `auth/status` is done (sanitized, file-existence heuristic). An
      authoritative `requiresLogin` would run the CLI's own `whoami`/auth command
      instead of the heuristic (slower, per-CLI).
- [ ] **Desktop embedded-mode IPC** — `src/handlers/desktop-handler.ts` is an empty
      stub; no `desktop/*` contracts exist in `shared/`. This is the bridge half of
      the desktop's **Phase 6** (embedded sidecar + mobile pairing); see
      `uxnandesktop/architecture/02e-bridge-integration.md`. Unbuilt on both sides.
- [ ] **`bridge/disconnectPhone`** — removes the session but does not close the live
      transport (`FOR-DEV:` in `bridge-control-handler.ts`). Also close the live
      transport so the phone is dropped immediately.

## Conversation history

- [ ] **Native-session history — ordered `segments`.** The live/stored path
      (`thread-store.ts`) emits `Message.segments` (interleaved text↔work-log
      order), so a phone reconnecting to a still-running bridge recovers the real
      order. The native-history readers in `session-history.ts` still emit
      `content` + `blocks` separately, so an imported external turn renders blocks-first
      (the phone falls back to `_assistantContents`). Reconstruct `segments` from
      each CLI log's real text↔tool order (Claude `tool_use` is interleaved in the
      assistant `content`; Codex/pi attach tool blocks after the text; OpenCode
      parts are read in file order) and
      attach them to each `RawMessage`. See the `FOR-DEV:` marker in
      `session-history.ts`.

## Agent adapters

- [ ] **Name conversations on Zero.** `IAgentAdapter.generateTitle` is wired for
      all seven active agents and **verified live on six**: Claude Code
      (`haiku`), Codex (`gpt-5.6-luna` at `low` effort, `codex exec --ephemeral
      -s read-only -o <file>`), OpenCode, pi, Antigravity
      (`gemini-3.6-flash-low`) and Grok. Zero's `zero exec
      <prompt>` form is confirmed **in Zero's own source** (its eval harness
      drives itself that way), but has never run: Zero is not installed here and
      the account has no credits. Run it once and drop this item.
      Also open: **a per-provider cheap model** for the multi-provider CLIs.
      OpenCode, pi and Grok route through many providers, so there is no fixed
      cheap-tier id to hard-code and they title on their own default. A
      configurable titling model belongs in daemon config. See the `#titleModel`
      marker in `pi-adapter.ts`.
- [ ] **Mid-turn steering as a per-agent capability.** The message queue (shipped)
      delivers a follow-up as its own turn once the current one ends — uniform
      across all seven active agents. What the CLIs additionally do is *steer*: inject the
      message into the running turn at the next tool-call boundary (Claude Code's
      TUI does this by default; Codex splits it as `Tab` = queue vs `Enter` =
      steer). The bridge cannot: the one-shot agents (`claude -p --resume`, pi,
      antigravity) have no input channel while they run — `spawn.ts` closes
      stdin because those CLIs hang on an open pipe. It IS reachable for the
      server-backed ones (Codex `app-server`, OpenCode `serve`, Zero/Grok ACP), so
      it belongs behind a new `AgentCapabilities.steering` flag the phone can read,
      alongside a `turn/steer` (or a `turn/send` mode) that the adapter maps to its
      protocol. Needs: the capability in `shared/`, per-adapter support, and a
      mobile affordance distinct from "queue". Unblocked — just not started.
- [ ] **Verify Codex `turn/steer` against a live turn.** The Codex half of
      mid-turn delivery is implemented and unit-tested against the published
      protocol schema (`codex app-server generate-json-schema`, codex-cli
      0.146.0), but has never run against a real turn: the account was at 100%
      of its weekly limit with `credits.balance: "0"` when it landed (resets
      2026-08-07). Steer a real Codex turn, confirm the follow-up lands inside
      it (one `turn/completed`), and record it in `docs/testing.md`. Claude Code
      and OpenCode were both verified live this way and are done.
      See the `FOR-DEV:` marker in `codex-adapter.ts`.
- [ ] **Per-model run options — phase 4 (fast-mode / context variants).** Phases 1–3
      are DONE (reasoning effort wired per agent + the per-model option schema in
      `shared/` `agent/models` + the mobile data-driven renderer). Phase 4 is fast-
      mode / context-window variants as opt-in knobs **only where a real CLI flag
      exists**. Validated: Claude has **no** fast-mode/context argv flag, Codex/pi
      have no fast mode — so there is little to wire today. Keep the option schema
      forward-compatible (unknown `kind` ignored by the phone) and only advertise a
      knob that maps to a real flag.
- [ ] **pi context-window %** — pi reports raw `totalTokens` (shown as a count like
      Codex). Map the resolved model's context window (pi `--list-models` exposes it)
      so the phone can render a `%` ring instead of a count.
- [ ] **Zero token usage** — the Agent Client Protocol carries no per-turn
      token/context usage over ACP — but it records one per turn in its own session
      store, which `readZeroUsage` now reads, so `reportsContextUsage:true`. The
      phone shows no context meter for Zero. Read usage from `zero usage` (or Zero's
      on-disk session store) and emit `usage` on `stream/turn/completed` so the meter
      lights up. See the `FOR-DEV:` marker in `zero-adapter.ts`.
- [ ] **Interactive `ask_user` for Zero** — Zero's `ask_user` tool is **non-interactive
      over ACP**: Zero's ACP agent (`internal/acp/agent.go`) wires no `OnAskUser` handler,
      so the loop auto-completes the call with "proceed with your best assumption" and
      never routes it to the client. The bridge therefore can't turn it into the
      interactive question card (the way OpenCode's `question` tool works); it only
      renders the questions legibly (`zero-tools.ts` `formatAskUser`). Making it
      answerable needs Zero to route `ask_user` to the ACP client (an **upstream** change,
      e.g. a vendor `_zero/ask_user` request or reusing `session/request_permission`);
      once it does, wire it into the existing `requestQuestion` round-trip.
- [ ] **Grok live-turn verification (balance-blocked)** — the ACP envelope,
      handshake and model discovery were exercised against a live `grok 0.2.93`, but
      a real turn could **not** be run because the test account's Grok Build balance
      was exhausted (HTTP 402 from `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com`). A funded account has
      since confirmed the hook vocabulary and **token usage** (both shipped); still
      to re-verify on a real turn: the per-turn `session/update` `tool_call`/`plan` shapes and
      arg names (`grok-tools.ts` assumes ACP-standard `kind`/`rawInput`/`content`),
      the `session/request_permission` option `kind`s, and whether
      `session/set_mode { modeId: <effort> }` actually applies the
      reasoning effort (it accepts any modeId without error). See the FOR-DEV notes
      in `grok-adapter.ts` / `grok-tools.ts`.
- [x] **Antigravity token usage & persistent stream-json session** — `AntigravityAdapter`
      now drives `agy` over `--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` in
      a persistent session per thread with a 2-hour idle timeout. Captured from `result.usage`,
      token usage (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `thinking_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`,
      `total_tokens`) is emitted on `turn_completed` and `reportsContextUsage: true` is enabled.

### Adding the next agent (recipe — do these one by one)

**Step 0, before any code: pick the surface and write it down.** Every CLI has
several headless surfaces and they do not behave alike — one may stream token
usage while another reports none, and an on-disk store can record something the
driven surface never emits. Choose the surface deliberately, then add its row to
[`docs/agents.md`](docs/agents.md) → *Drive surface* (surface, transport/framing,
whether it reports usage) **in the same change set**. Validate every claim by
running the adapter and reading what it emits — two shipped "fixes" were
validated against a surface the bridge does not drive, and did nothing.


Pick the template that matches the CLI's headless surface. For a **persistent
per-thread child process** copy `pi-adapter.ts`; for a **one-shot per-turn CLI**
(spawns once per turn) copy `claude-adapter.ts`; for a **long-lived server** with
a pre-tool approval channel copy `codex-adapter.ts` or `zero-adapter.ts` (JSON-RPC over
stdio) or `opencode-adapter.ts` (HTTP/SSE over `opencode serve`).

1. Run the real CLI by hand once and capture a turn's machine-readable stream
   (a `--json|--format json` one-shot, or the server's event stream). **Watch for
   stdin:** the one-shot CLIs hang on an open stdin pipe — spawn with
   `stdio:['ignore','pipe','pipe']`.
2. Copy the closest template; adjust the args/request builder (subcommand, model
   flag, session/continue flag, cwd) and the event parser for that CLI's shape.
   Keep `shell:false` and pass the prompt as an argv element / request body (no
   injection).
3. Register it in `startBridge` with display metadata + availability. Then wire it
   into `agent/models` (discovery), the `*-tools.ts` block mapper (structured
   content), `SessionHistoryReader` (native-session `turn/list` convergence), and approvals if
   the CLI exposes a pre-tool channel.

- [ ] **Antigravity native-session history** — `agy` exposes no history/export
      command and its `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/<uuid>.db` stores
      opaque step payloads, so `SessionHistoryReader` deliberately does not infer
      messages from it. Revisit only if Antigravity exposes a stable supported
      transcript API or documented payload schema; do not reverse-engineer
      brittle blobs into user-visible history.

## Daemon lifecycle & ops

- [ ] **Log size-rotation + retention** — `createFileLogger` does daily rotation +
      secret redaction; add size-based rotation + pruning of old log files.
- [ ] **Relay autostart** — only needed for remote/off-LAN (LAN-only needs no relay).

## Packaging — npm publish readiness

`bin`/`files`/`engines`/`repository`/`prepublishOnly` are set on all three packages,
and `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml` automates the tag-driven publish. The
**first publish shipped** (`0.0.1-alpha.20260627`, `alpha` dist-tag) — the workflow
pinned `@uxnan/shared` to the exact version at publish time, validated by the
successful run. Remaining post-publish hardening:

- [ ] **Packed-install smoke** — `npm pack` each package, `npm install -g
      ./uxnan-bridge-*.tgz`, run `uxnan-bridge qr`.
- [ ] **Executable bit** — ensure `scripts/*.sh` keep their executable bit on the
      packed tarball.
- [ ] **OIDC publishing** — migrate from `NPM_TOKEN` to npm Trusted Publishing after
      the first publish; enable provenance.

## Ops / nice-to-haves

- [ ] **CLI version-update notice** — on startup compare `BRIDGE_VERSION` against the
      npm registry and print an upgrade hint (no auto-update; silent when offline).

## Known issues

- [ ] **Echo-agent E2E flaky on Windows CI** — the end-to-end turn-routing + approval
      round-trip tests in `bridge/test/handlers/thread-handlers.test.ts` intermittently
      never report `completed` on **Windows CI runners** (time out even at 120s), while
      passing reliably on Linux CI. Skipped on Windows CI only via
      `SKIP_ECHO_E2E_ON_WIN_CI`. **Note:** a large share of the historical Windows
      `waitFor timed out` failures — including the ones that hit `agent-manager.test.ts`
      and reddened a release run — were NOT this: they were a refused atomic-write
      `rename` (EPERM), now retried in `DaemonState.writeJson`. Re-check whether this
      guard is still needed before investigating the stdio path further; it may already
      be fixed.

## Relay hardening (relay-only)

Multi-session `mac` registration + auth-on-forwarding are relay-only and tracked in
[`relay/FOR-DEV.md`](../relay/FOR-DEV.md) (the authoritative list). They do not block
the bridge.
